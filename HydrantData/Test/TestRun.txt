=====What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda? - BBC NewsUKEnglandN. IrelandScotlandAlbaWalesCymruIsle of ManGuernseyJerseyLocal NewsWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Published13 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCalais migrant crisisImage source, Getty ImagesThe UK government wants to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.In November, the UK Supreme Court ruled the plan was unlawful because of the risk that asylum seekers sent to Rwanda could be returned to their home countries, where they could face harm.In response, the government signed a new treaty with Rwanda to strengthen its asylum process, and proposed new UK laws declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. What is the Rwanda asylum plan?Under the five-year trial - first announced in April 2022 - some asylum seekers arriving in the UK would be sent to Rwanda for processing. On arrival, they could be granted refugee status and allowed to stay. If not, they could apply to settle there on other grounds, or seek asylum in another "safe third country". The government said that "anyone entering the UK illegally" after 1 January 2022 could be sent there, with no limit on numbers. But, so far, no asylum seeker has actually been sent.The first flight was scheduled to go in June 2022, but was cancelled after legal challenges.The government insists that the policy would deter people arriving in the UK through "illegal, dangerous or unnecessary methods", such as on small boats across the English Channel. In January, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said "stopping the boats" was one of his key priorities.How many people cross the Channel in small boats and how many claim asylum in the UK?New UK visa rules: How is the governmentís immigration policy changing?What does the new bill say about the safety of Rwanda?The government says that the bill - which must be approved by Parliament - makes clear in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country.The legislation orders British judges and courts to ignore some sections of the UK Human Rights Act. Asylum seekers would still be able to challenge their removal to Rwanda based on their personal circumstances. But ministers could ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard.Some Conservative politicians are unhappy with the proposed law, because they think it risks being blocked by the courts again. Others have criticised the legislation because they believe it breaks international law.Image source, ReutersImage caption, PM Rishi Sunak met Tory MPs to bolster support for the bill ahead of the House of Commons voteThe bill passed its first vote in Parliament, but could still face hurdles at later stages. No Conservative MPs voted against the legislation, but some chose not to vote at all. Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Sunak takes the win but the battle is not overWhy did the Supreme Court block sending people to Rwanda?The UK Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the Rwanda scheme was unlawful. It said genuine refugees sent there would be at risk of being returned to their home countries, where they could face harm, known in law as "refoulement".This breaches part of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment. The UK is a signatory to the ECHR. The judges said the policy contravenes three other laws passed by Parliament during the last 30 years.The ruling also cited concerns about Rwanda's poor human rights record, and its past treatment of refugees. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) told the Court that the Rwandan authorities turned down 100% of all asylum claims made by people from Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria between 2020 and 2022.The Rwandan government rejected the Court judgement: "We take our humanitarian responsibilities seriously, and will continue to live up to them."How the UK's asylum deal is viewed in RwandaWhat does the new treaty with Rwanda say?On 5 December, the UK signed a new migration treaty with Rwanda.Home Secretary James Cleverley says it guarantees that any people sent to Rwanda to claim asylum would not be at risk of refoulement. Other provisions include:a new independent monitoring committee to ensure Rwanda complies with its obligationsthe UK will pay for British and Commonwealth judges to preside over a new appeals processthe UK will also pay the accommodation and living expenses of people relocated to Rwanda for up to five yearsWhat will the Rwanda plan cost? The government gave £140m to Rwanda in 2022. On 7 December, the Home Office's top civil servant confirmed that a further £100m was given to the country in 2023, with a payment of £50m "anticipated" in 2024.Ahead of the vote on the new Rwanda bill, James Cleverly confirmed to Parliament that the UK plans to give a further £50m to Rwanda in 2026. In November, the PM claimed that the Rwanda plan will "literally save us billions in the long run", but did not provide any figures to back this up. An earlier economic-impact assessment prepared for the government's Illegal Migration Bill estimated that removing each individual to a third country, such as Rwanda, would cost £63,000 more than keeping them in the UK. Image source, ReutersImage caption, Legal challenges meant the first Rwanda flight was cancelled shortly before take-off in June 2022The Home Office said no cost would be incurred if the policy prevented an individual from entering the UK illegally, but it could not say how many people would be deterred. The UK's asylum system costs £3bn a year. About £8m a day is spent on hotel accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers. Where is Rwanda?Rwanda is a small land-locked country in east-central Africa, 4,000 miles (6,500km) south-east of the UK, It borders Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Tanzania and Uganda, and has a population of 13.8 million. President Paul Kagame hopes to win a fourth term in 2024, which would extend his term to nearly three decades.At the last election in 2017, he won nearly 99% of the vote, but critics accuse him of supressing his opponents. According to Human Rights Watch, "Rwanda is a country where it's very dangerous to oppose the government". Land of safety - or fear?

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.THE GATES of North Korea, closed since January 2020 ostensibly to keep covid-19 out, are finally creaking open. On August 27th North Korean state media announced that citizens who had been locked out of the country during the pandemic were starting to return home. Some North Korean civil aeroplanes have already made return trips to Beijing.Many will welcome any relaxation of restrictions, in the hope it will lead to more food imports from China to stave off the countryís endemic shortages. But for one group of North Koreans the news inspires dread. According to the UN as many as 2,000 North Korean defectors are now languishing in Chinese prisons, awaiting a possible forced return to a country that deals extremely harshly with those suspected of trying to escape its clutches.Some North Koreans were trapped in China against their wishes when the borders shut. Many of them had gone there, with the permission of Kim Jong Unís regime, to study or earn money for the state. After so much time away from its propagandists, they are likely to be forced to endure re-education to reassure the authorities of their ideological reliability.Others left without the regimeís approval, either to engage in trade or to escape its tyranny. They can expect rougher treatment. Merely crossing the border without permission is punishable by up to five years of ìreform through labourî. Those repatriated in the past have been subjected to torture, sexual violence, forced abortions and other forms of mistreatment, says Su Bo-bae, a researcher at the Database Centre for North Korean Human Rights, a think-tank in Seoul.An escapee interviewed by another rights group, Rights for Female North Korean Defectors, was imprisoned after being forcibly repatriated from China. He was sentenced to hard labour and forced to adopt stress positions for five hours every morning. Violence in his facility was routine. He recalled seeing a guard grabbing an elderly woman by the hair until it came out in clumps and pounding her face.Although the situation is most worrying for North Koreans in detention in China, all defectors there are at risk. In recent years Chinese digital surveillance infrastructure has improved and fake residency cards have become harder to obtain. The need to show a QR code linked to residence papers when entering public places during the pandemic has made undocumented North Koreans easier to spot.Most defectors are women and many risk being separated from their children if sent back. A defector who spoke to The Economist and other media outlets in South Korea, at a naturalisation centre for North Korean arrivals, exemplifies this. She escaped to China in 2014 and married and had children thereóbefore escaping to the South for fear of repatriation. ìI had something to protect,î she says, ìI was worried about my familyî.When reminded by the UN of its legal obligation not to return anyone to a country where they might be tortured, the Chinese government routinely responds that North Korean border-crossers are economic migrants whom it handles ìin keeping with Chinese laws, international law and humanitarianismî. This illustrates Chinaís broader see-no-evil approach to its neighbourís transgressions. On August 17th the UN Security Council addressed North Korean human-rights abuses for the first time in five years. Chinaís representative called the discussion ìirresponsible, unconstructive and an abuse of the councilís powerî.In the build-up to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, China permitted seven North Korean defectors to travel to third countries. Some activists have suggested it might make a similar allowance ahead of the Asian Games in Hangzhou in September. This is optimistic. Before the Olympics, China and Western countries were co-operating in a joint effort to talk the North Koreans out of their nuclear ambitions. Now Sino-American rivalry is raging and China, fiercely opposed to the West, seems unmoved by any North Korean outrage.source


=====The key NHS targets that have never been met - BBC NewsHealthThe key NHS targets that have never been metPublished1 day agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesBy Nick Triggle and Hugh PymBBC NewsMost key NHS targets have been missed for at least seven years across the UK, BBC News research shows.The review of records going back 20 years also reveals Northern Ireland and Wales have never met the four-hour accident-and-emergency (A&E) target.The analysis focused on the three key hospital targets, covering A&E, cancer and waiting times for planned care.Combined, the length of time during which the targets have been missed tops 100 years.In the past seven, the only one to have been met is the A&E target in Scotland - and that was during lockdown in 2020, when the number of visits to A&E plummeted. All four nations said improving waiting times was a priority and investment was being made.But in an exclusive interview with the BBC, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said not enough was being done.He highlighted the disproportionate number of children on the waiting list - and unveiled a new pledge that no child will wait longer than the target time of 18 weeks for hospital treatment if he were elected prime minister.He said it was "shocking" that so many children - more than 180,000 - were waiting longer than 18 weeks."Most people across the country would assume children are the priority. Long waits impair their mental and physical development," Sir Keir added.Currently there is no separate target for children and to hit the overall target 92% of patients need to be seen in 18 weeks.Sir Keir said under his plan there would be no wriggle room.The comments came as Labour unveiled its child health action plan with the vision of creating the "healthiest generation of children ever".To ensure this happens, the party has proposed a ban on junk food advertising, more breakfast clubs in primary schools and supervised teeth-brushing for young children.'Wake-up call'King's Fund think tank chief analyst Siva Anandaciva said the findings of the BBC analysis should "act as a wake-up call"."These are the key totemic targets," he said. "The length of time they have been missed is incredible."Patients groups warned the delays were putting patients at risk.Patients Association chief executive Rachel Power said the analysis showed the NHS was in "permacrisis"."The health of many deteriorates while they await treatment and their problems become more complex," she said.

Eg ëB1 1RFí Last updated: Thursday 11 January About the data About the data Data for England is shown by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. Data for Wales and Scotland is shown by Health Board and in Northern Ireland by Health and Social Care Trust. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board and by Health and Social Care trust in Northern Ireland. Comparative data is shown for a previous year where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Earlier data is not available for all measures, so comparisons between years are not always possible. In England and Northern Ireland A&E attendances include all emergency departments in that trust or health board, not just major A&E departments. For example, those who attend minor injury units are included. In Wales the data include all emergency departments, but does not include patients kept in A&E by doctors under special circumstances, [more details here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-67056279). In Scotland the data includes only major A&E departments. Each nation has different target times and definitions for some of the measures shown, therefore comparisons between them are not possible. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive. Kate Seymour, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: "The impact this is having on people living with cancer, their families and friends is nothing short of heartbreaking. They deserve better." British Medical Association leader Prof Philip Banfield said the figures showed the "dire decline" of the NHS during the years of austerity. Services were "stretched beyond their limits" across the UK, he said."Front-line staff are unable to provide the care they've trained so hard to undertake and that patients so desperately need," Prof Banfield added.Can the NHS survive to 100?The NHS backlog: Who are the 7 million?'Worst time of my life'Whether waiting in A&E or for cancer care to begin or an operation, the impact of significant delays on patients is immense.Ian Binns waited four months for cancer treatment for bowel cancer - twice as long as he should have.During this time the 66-year-old, from Nottingham, went from stage one to late stage four.He described the wait as the "worst time of my life"."I would wake up every morning wondering if I had a future."Image source, OtherImage caption, Ian Binns waited four months for cancer treatment- twice as long as he should haveHis cancer is now incurable as it has spread. "Our greatest tools are rapid diagnosis and timely treatment. Where was the help when I needed it?"David Corbitt's wait did not have such a devastating effect.But he still described the experience as awful when he went to A&E because of concerns over a potential heart problem.He was advised by an out-of-hours GP to seek help after feeling unwell - he was light-headed and was struggling with his coordination.The 66-year-old, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, got a friend to drive him straight to hospital. "I hadn't been to an A&E unit for a few years and I was surprised how busy it was. There were people everywhere."It was an evening and I spent 13 hours - the whole night - sitting there on a chair before I was seen. It was awful."He eventually underwent tests and was discharged home."The staff were doing their best, but there was not enough of them. It should not be like this, he added."''Unacceptable waits'The Department of Health in Northern Ireland acknowledged the waiting times were "unacceptable" and work was under way to tackle them.But it said significant progress would require sustained additional investment and the lack of a devolved government meant it was unable to plan for the long-term.A Welsh government spokeswoman said extra money was being invested, adding: "We have placed a clear focus on those patients with an urgent need and who have waited the longest."A spokeswoman for NHS England said progress was being made, with the numbers facing really long waits falling and signs the NHS was coping better this winter than last. The latest figures released on Thursday supported this, showing A&E waits were slightly better than this time last year, while the waiting list has dropped for a second month in a row. But both are a long way from meeting the targets.Labour, which is in power in Wales, has promised it will achieve the key waiting time targets in England by the end of the next parliament if it wins the election.Image source, Getty ImagesThe three targets were all rolled out during the 2000s and have been used to track performance ever since.Each nation decides how they are measured.The four-hour A&E target is similar between each - but there are significant differences for planned hospital treatment.For example, in England it is meant to be within 18 weeks of a referral 92% of the time - and that covers everything from knee and hip operations for which patients are admitted through to outpatient appointments.In Northern Ireland, the target is 13 weeks 55% of the time - but that is just for patients who need to be admitted.Have you experienced long waits for treatment?

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.The new year has not started well for Germany‚Äôs ruling ‚Äútraffic-light‚Äù coalition, nor indeed for traffic. On January 8th angry farmers blocked autobahns across the country, even as train drivers called a national strike. As statisticians revealed grim final numbers for 2023‚Äîsuch as a 3.1% real-terms fall in retail sales from 2022‚Äîpollsters unsurprisingly found that 82% of Germans are dissatisfied with the government. A survey measuring confidence in the office of the chancellor detected a vertiginous 55-point plunge between late 2020, when Angela Merkel still reigned, and now under Olaf Scholz.Yet one person‚Äôs bad luck may prove another‚Äôs chance. Consider the case of Sahra Wagenknecht. The 54-year-old left-wing populist chose January 8th as the date to launch her new party. Right now the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance for Reason and Fairness (BSW is the shortened German acronym), looks minuscule, with only ten MPs in the 736-seat Bundestag. Yet it stands to profit both from Mr Scholz‚Äôs distress and from fortuitous timing.Ms Wagenknecht, who in October quit Germany‚Äôs main leftist party, Die Linke, leans to the left of the government on social spending and in reluctance to support Ukraine, but to its right in seeking sharp curbs on immigration. That combination resounds with an increasingly frustrated electorate. A survey of voters who would consider voting for the BSW found 40% cited disappointment with other parties as the top reason, 28% Ms Wagenknecht‚Äôs charms and 25% the issue of immigration.Two big political opportunities also loom for the BSW. German voters tend to take elections to the European Parliament less seriously than national ones, and see them as a chance to experiment. The vote is set for June, giving the novel party six months to campaign. In September three eastern states will hold elections. Former East Germany happens to be where the ruling coalition is most disliked. It helps that Ms Wagenknecht is herself an easterner. Brought up in East Berlin, she remained a communist through the fall of the Wall and university, where she studied economics and philosophy. Her poise, precise diction and relentless scorn heaped on the government score strongly in a region made anxious by high inflation, relative poverty, fear of immigrants and a sense of alienation from the elite. Many East Germans share Ms Wagenknecht‚Äôs suspicion of the West and blame Ukraine, not Russia, for ‚Äúprovoking‚Äù a war for its own survival.Those same impulses have boosted another relatively new outsider, the hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), into second place in popularity, with a projected 22% of votes in a national election. Although the two parties ostensibly occupy opposite political poles, some pundits believe Ms Wagenknecht could draw more voters away from the AfD than from mainstream parties such as Mr Scholz‚Äôs Social Democrats. One survey found 55% of AfD supporters, and 40% in Die Linke, would consider voting for the BSW. Far fewer in other parties said they might switch.Undercut by Ms Wagenknecht, Die Linke looks close to falling under the 5% threshold. Yet it is too soon for right-wingers to cheer. Hans-Georg Maassen, a former head of German intelligence who heads a hard-right splinter in the opposition Christian Democratic Union, the flagship of German conservatism, now wants to set up his own party. Meanwhile the Free Democrats, a small right-of-centre partner in the traffic-light coalition, also flounder near the 5% threshold. By the time of the next national election, in 2025, the upstart BSW may look less a minnow among sharks than one among many fish. ‚ñ†To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf√© Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.Explore moreGermanyThis article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline "Traffic jam"Europe January 13th 2024Who is in charge of Europe?The president appoints modern France‚Äôs youngest prime ministerGermany‚Äôs new party on the far left may eat into the far rightHow the spirit of Jacques Delors might be rekindledFrom the January 13th 2024 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Explore the editionShareReuse this contentMore from EuropeHow the spirit of Jacques Delors might be rekindledAs the EU mourns, what would Jacques do?The president appoints modern France‚Äôs youngest prime ministerCan the 34-year-old Gabriel Attal revive Emmanuel Macron‚Äôs fortunes?Who is in charge of Europe?The East is up, Germany is down, Britain is outSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentHelp and contact usKeep updatedLinkedInFacebookXInstagramThreadsTikTokYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in ‚Äúa severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.‚Äù The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist Impact EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesExecutive JobsTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Data RightsCopyright ¬© The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.

But they have been amplified by El Ni√±o, a natural climate cycle, which could make 2024 hotter still.‚ñ†For more coverage of climate change, sign up for The Climate Issue, our fortnightly subscriber-only newsletter, or visit our climate-change hub.This article appeared in the Science & technology section of the print edition under the headline "The hottest year ever"Science & technology January 13th 2024Heart attacks, strokes, dementia‚Äîcan Biden and Trump beat the odds?Simine Vazire hopes to fix psychology‚Äôs credibility crisis2023 was the hottest year everWind turbines are friendlier to birds than oil-and-gas drillingAn American rocket has a fine debut; not so the Moon lander on boardFrom the January 13th 2024 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Explore the editionShareReuse this contentMore from Science and technologySimine Vazire hopes to fix psychology‚Äôs credibility crisisHer new job editing the field‚Äôs most prestigious journal should helpWind turbines are friendlier to birds than oil-and-gas drillingContrary to what opponents of wind farms fearHeart attacks, strokes, dementia‚Äîcan Biden and Trump beat the odds?What the science of ageing has to say about the presidential electionSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentHelp and contact usKeep updatedLinkedInFacebookXInstagramThreadsTikTokYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in ‚Äúa severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.‚Äù The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist Impact EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesExecutive JobsTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Data RightsCopyright ¬© The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.

=====Pass rate falls for GCSE maths resits in England - BBC NewsFamily & EducationYoung ReporterPass rate falls for GCSE maths resits in EnglandPublished1 day agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesBy Hazel ShearingEducation correspondentThe pass rate for GCSE maths resits in England has fallen, after more students had to take their exams again.November's exam results show 22.9% of maths entries were marked at a grade 4, a standard pass, or above, down from 24.9% in 2022 and 26.9% in 2019.However, the pass rate for GCSE English resits rose to 40.3% - up from 38% and 32.3% respectively.Under-18s in England must retake GCSE English and maths if they did not get at least a grade 4.The overall GCSE pass rate fell last summer, when grades in England were brought back in line with pre-pandemic levels.Exams sat in November, which are typically resits, were marked on the same basis.Ahead of the November resits, colleges told the BBC they were having to expand class sizes and hire exam halls to cope with a rising number of pupils taking compulsory GCSE resits.How does the GCSE grading system work?Class sizes grow to keep up with GCSE resitsExams were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 and grades were based on teachers' assessments, leading to a rise in top results.Grades were brought back to 2019 levels in England last summer - meaning a lower pass-rate, and, therefore, more students having to take compulsory resits.More than 167,000 students in England received grade 3 or lower on their maths paper last summer - about 21,000 more than in 2022.A further 172,000 failed English language - 38,000 more.At the same time, there are more teenagers coming through the system.Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests there will be a 17% rise in the number of 16 and 17-year-olds between 2019 and 2024 - an extra 200,000 young people.Although the pass rate fell in maths, the raw number of passes in both maths and English grew, because more students sat November exams than in previous years.There were 117,098 entries for maths and English in November - compared with 91,357 in 2022 and 102,960 in 2019.Eddie Playfair, senior policy manager at the Association of Colleges, welcomed the rise in pass grades.He said November candidates will be "only a subset of the total number resitting" - as students can also resit in the summer - and "will tend to be those most likely to improve their grade quickly".England's exams regulator, Ofqual, said the return to "normal grading" last year meant it was "not meaningful to make direct comparisons between results in recent November series".Comparisons with 2019 were included in the release of the November results - the last year exams were sat before the pandemic.'Remorseless'Tom Middlehurst, assessment specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, said the compulsory resit policy "consigns the majority of young people to a remorseless cycle of falling below the grade 4 bar". He said schools and colleges have tried to help students catch up on "lost learning" because of the Covid pandemic, but have "constrained resources".The fall in the maths pass rate comes after the government announced plans to replace A-levels and T-levels with a new Advanced British Standard which would include some English and maths to 18.A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said: "Young people who leave education with a good grasp of English and maths have a much better chance of securing a job or going on to further study."The DfE said it was investing an extra ¬£1.6bn in colleges by 2024-25, compared with the 2021-22 financial year, and an extra ¬£470m over this year and next would would help colleges boost recruitment and retention of staff.Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?

More info√óGroup 28Thank you for subscribing!We have more newslettersShow MeNo thanks, closeSee our Privacy Notice Edinburgh‚Äôs shortage of Grade A office space continues to stifle deal activity, with this trend expected to continue over the next two years, according to property services firm JLL. Total take-up in Edinburgh in 2023 totalled 661,000 square feet, with the largest deal being Analog Devices‚Äô lease of 28,000 square feet at 2 Freer Street. This represents an 18% reduction, compared to the 10-year average of 806,000 square feet. A total of 168 new deals completed in 2023. While a slight improvement on 2022‚Äôs figure of 151, deal volumes are 16% below the five-year pre-pandemic average, demonstrating that occupiers are still reviewing their options and delaying their relocation decisions. Consequently, headline rents in the city centre have grown from ¬£40.00 per square foot at the end of 2022 to ¬£43.00 per square foot to finish the year ‚Äì a 7.5% year-on-year growth and 13.2% up over the previous 24 months. JLL attributed this to the short supply of best-in-class office space, which has become an increasing priority for businesses in recent years. Strong demand for this stock and growing concerns around inward investment is leading to apprehension that Edinburgh‚Äôs city centre might begin to inhibit business growth, the report noted, adding that where there has been growth within the life science sectors, this lack of supply is detrimental for the city‚Äôs identity as a business incubator. With an increasing number of Edinburgh businesses continuing to encourage the return to the office, JLL forecasts the shortage will worsen without a marked influx of new development or refurbished stock to replenish the lack of supply. Hannah Done, associate director at JLL in Edinburgh, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hard-hitting fact that there is currently no availability of Grade A office space amongst Edinburgh‚Äôs build stock, and we anticipate that this trend will persist into 2024 without more speculative refurbishment from investors. ‚ÄúNotably, a contributing factor to this has been the continued theme of obsolete office buildings - prime for office redevelopment - being converted for alternative uses like hotels, representing big loss for the city‚Äôs professional sector and creating concerns for future prosperity. ‚ÄúWithout a step change in development intentions, this poses the city with a serious lack of space for business or enterprise growth,‚Äú she continued, adding: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre likely to see pressure continue to grow on businesses to secure prime space far in advance of when they plan to move to avoid competition. ‚ÄúAnecdotally, we‚Äôre seeing occupiers with leases expiring as far away as 2028 searching the market for opportunities which might meet their ESG targets and timeframes.‚Äù Don't miss the latest headlines with our twice-daily newsletter - sign up here for free.

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.In GERMany, where workers and bosses run many companies jointly, a big strike is unusual. A wave of big strikes is almost unheard of. Right now the country of ‚Äúco-determination‚Äù is simultaneously facing an eight-day ‚Äúaction week‚Äù by irate farmers, who blocked roads with tractors, a three-day strike of railway workers and, to top it off, a looming strike of doctors, who already closed surgeries between Christmas and New Year‚Äôs Day. This Mistgabelmop (pitchfork mob), as some have taken to calling it, will test Germany‚Äôs harmonious labour relations in the year to come.The protests were ostensibly set off by the government‚Äôs decision to end subsidies for diesel fuel used in agriculture and to cut an exemption from car tax for farm vehicles. These measures pushed farmers over the edge. It also mobilised other angry workers, already straining under the pressure of inflation, recession and the government‚Äôs self-imposed austerity. On January 9th drivers of freight and passenger trains at Deutsche Bahn, the national railway, began a strike over working hours and pay.In an effort to defuse the tension with the farmers, the government agreed to a gradual removal of the diesel subsidy over three years and to keeping the exemption from the car tax. The farmers pooh-poohed the concessions as insufficient. On January 4th an aggressive group of them prevented Robert Habeck, the economy minister, from disembarking from a ferry on his return from a family holiday. If the train drivers are similarly unimpressed, that could prove expensive for German business, reckons IW K√∂ln, a think-tank. The rail strike could cost businesses ‚Ç¨100m ($110m) a day if it forced them to interrupt production. The car, chemical and steel industries, Germany‚Äôs biggest, are especially reliant on rail transport.The workers‚Äô mood is increasingly angry. ‚ÄúAppeals are circulating with fantasies of revolution,‚Äù warned Mr Habeck. The far-right Alternative for Germany party is doing its best to fan the grievances. In Dresden the Free Saxons, another far-right group, infiltrated the farmers‚Äô protest calling for the ‚Äúextinction of the traffic light‚Äù (as the governing coalition of the Social Democrats, Free Democrats and Greens is referred to because of their party colours).Thomas Puls of IW K√∂ln fears that the strikes will harm the image of Germany as a place for business. Local bosses are already fretting about a German version of the gilets jaunes protests in France in 2018, which culminated in yellow-jacketed demonstrators torching cars on the Champs-Elys√©es and the police stepping in with tear gas. Jochen Kopelke, head of Germany‚Äôs police union, warned in an interview with Tagesspiegel, a daily, that the farmers were probably ‚Äújust the start of an enormous wave of protest this year‚Äù. Germany was the only big economy to shrink in 2023, and the year ended on an especially sour note, with an unexpected drop in business confidence in December.

=====Post Office may face ¬£100m tax bill over victim payouts - experts - BBC NewsBusinessMarket DataEconomyYour MoneyCompaniesTechnology of BusinessCEO SecretsArtificial IntelligencePost Office may face ¬£100m tax bill over victim payouts - expertsPublished1 hour agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsPost Office InquiryImage source, Getty ImagesBy Simon JackBusiness editorThe Post Office may have underpaid more than ¬£100m in tax while overpaying its senior executives, according to tax experts.Dan Neidle of Tax Policy Associates says the Post Office paid less tax by deducting payments to victims of the Horizon scandal from its profits.This could count as a possible breach of tax law, according to experts.The Post Office said its financial information was "appropriate and accurate".It has been paying out to sub-postmasters who have had their theft convictions quashed.Repaying the alleged shortfall to HMRC could render the Post Office technically insolvent and would involve the government stepping in to financially support it.However as the Post Office is owned by the government, exacting financial penalties is tantamount to the government fining itself and no-one is suggesting the Post Office will cease to function. Corporation tax is paid to the government by UK companies and foreign companies with UK offices.It is charged on their profits - the amount of money companies make, minus their costs such as staff and raw materials.While businesses can claim corporate tax deductions for legitimate business expenses, costs related to penalties or fines are not generally tax deductible.In this instance, the Post Office allegedly deducted the payments made to victims of the Horizon IT scandal from their revenue, resulting in a lower profit and therefore a lower tax bill. Can scheme to quash Post Office convictions work?PM backs calls to knight Post Office campaignerPost Office paid Fujitsu ¬£95m to extend HorizonMr Neidle said: "The non-deductibility of compensation for unlawful acts is a well-known point."Heather Self from accounting and advisory firm Blick Rothenberg agreed. "The payments of compensation by the Post Office are almost certainly not deductible for corporation tax purposes, in my view. Not only is it difficult to argue that they were incurred for trading purposes, there is also a general rule of public policy that fines - or payments in the nature of fines - are not deductible." The BBC understands that HMRC is investigating the way that the Post Office has accounted for the compensation payments and provisions. In its most recently published financial accounts, the risk of a significant adverse tax ruling is acknowledged.Notes to the accounts include the following: "As at the balance sheet date the company was engaged in discussions with HMRC regarding potential taxation liabilities that could arise in relation to past events but for which no liability has currently been recognised". It continues "the Directors recognise that an adverse outcome could be material".Mr Neidle estimates that deducting postmaster compensation from the Post Office's trading profit would mean that it underpaid more than ¬£100m in corporation tax. The Post Office does not currently have enough money to pay that bill and would therefore, Mr Neidle argues, be technically insolvent.A spokesman said that HMRC could not comment on specific business or individuals but said: "We collect the tax due under the law, creating a level playing field for everyone and funding public services." The Post Office said its financial information was "appropriate and accurate" and it was in discussions with HMRC and the Department for Business and Trade, which oversees the state-owned company.Executive payWhile the Post Office appears to have deducted compensation provisions from their taxable profits, it apparently ignored them when it came to calculating executive pay. The largest determinant of bosses' pay is a measure the Post Office calls "trading profit", which excludes the money set aside to compensate scandal victims, thereby increasing the pay of executives. Chief executive Nick Read received a salary of ¬£436,000 in the year ended 2022, plus a bonus of ¬£137,000, as the Post Office was deemed to have recorded an above target trading profit if compensation provisions were ignored. Mr Neidle said: "Bonuses have been paid to the executive team based on an apparent level of profitability which does not exist. If a public company missed an obvious tax point that made the business insolvent the shareholders would be demanding the CFO and CEOs head on a platter".Related TopicsPost Office InquiryPost Office LtdMore on this storyHow do the Post Office compensation schemes work?Published1 day agoCan scheme to quash Post Office convictions work?Published2 days agoTop StoriesLive.

=====Public rights of way blocked in 32,000 places - BBC NewsScience & EnvironmentPublic rights of way blocked in 32,000 placesPublished21 hours agocommentsCommentsShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, "The path is there... somewhere" - watch volunteers from The Ramblers negotiating blocked rights of wayBy Malcolm Prior and Claire MarshallBBC News rural affairs teamWalkers wanting to enjoy footpaths across the British countryside are being blocked or obstructed in nearly 32,000 places across England and Wales.But they are fighting back, with one rambler even training as a lawyer to force councils to keep the way clear.A BBC investigation found councils which have responsibility for footpaths had 4,000 more access issues on public rights of way in 2023 than in 2022.Campaigners said this showed a "growing abuse and neglect" of the path network.Local authorities said "funding constraints" limited what they can do.In Cornwall, which has 2,796 miles (4,500km) of public rights of way, Lucy Wilson is one walker determined to make sure countryside footpaths are kept useable.Image source, BBC/Claire MarshallImage caption, Campaigner Lucy Wilson has trained as a lawyer in order to challenge her local council's work on accessStanding on a footpath tucked into the folds of the Tamar Valley, Mrs Wilson points up at a sheer muddy bank, topped with a thicket of brambles."That's where the path should go," she says. "You can't see anything. It's just gone." Her finger traces the registered right of way on a map on her phone. We scramble up the bank but have no chance of forcing our way past the thorns. She explains that people have been trying for five years to get Cornwall Council to make this path accessible. "The council doesn't have the resources - but that's not an excuse, because they have a statutory duty to do this. It's not a choice," she explains.All landowners have a duty to keep paths clear but the ultimate responsibility rests with the local highways authority - usually the local county or unitary council or national park authority.'Shocking neglect'Mrs Wilson, a campaigner with the Open Spaces Society, estimates that half of the Cornish footpath network has unresolved issues. She began her fight to get paths cleared in 2015 and is now training as a lawyer to try to force the council to act. "I was trying to enjoy the countryside, and I found on quite a few occasions, I couldn't because there were gates locked, they were overgrown, impossible to get through. "I thought rather naively, that just reporting the obstructions to the council, the council would come along and clear them. And it didn't happen. And so here I am in 2023, some of those same paths remain obstructed," she said.Cornwall Council told the BBC that it was "committed to protecting the public rights of way across Cornwall"."Each case is determined on its own merits and we will consider the best course of action to ensure any obstructions are removed. "The council has a finite resource and must prioritise workload accordingly," a spokesperson explained.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The BBC asked 118 local authorities how many obstacles, blockages and inaccessible footpaths they had in their areas.Meanwhile, across England and Wales, The Ramblers - Britain's walking charity - say they are coming across similar problems - but the true scale of blocked and obstructed footpaths has so far remained unknown.So the BBC used Environmental Information Regulations to ask 118 local councils outside of London and national park authorities how many blockages and obstructions were recorded at the end of 2022 and on a specific day - 31 October 2023.Seventy-three authorities were able to provide the data, with 31,816 obstructions - ranging from overgrown vegetation to deliberately fenced-off paths - recorded on 31 October, an increase from 27,696 at the end of 2022.Kate Ashbrook, general secretary of the Open Spaces Society, said the results of the BBC's investigation showed "a shocking and growing abuse and neglect of our public path network".She added that local authorities were "failing to carry out their legal duties to assert and protect the public's rights to enjoy these public highways". Jack Cornish, head of paths for The Ramblers, said obstructions and blockages were a common issue "but we are shocked to learn quite how many of these issues on paths remain unresolved". "In fact, we suspect there are vastly more blockages and obstructions than the figures show, because our own research shows that the public don't know how, or where, to report issues they experience on paths," he added.The councils themselves say "funding constraints" limit the amount of footpath maintenance they can do. "Long-term, consistent funding would help councils plan ahead for maintenance and to reduce obstructions on rights of way," said Darren Rodwell, transport spokesperson for the Local Government Association.The UK government said English councils' funding settlement for 2024/25 is more than ¬£64bn and they were "best placed to decide how this funding is spent, including on maintaining the public paths network".But the government is also working with landowners themselves - last week it announced new funding incentives would be on offer to farmers next year to create, maintain and upgrade footpaths.Environment secretary Steve Barclay told the BBC: "The best way of unblocking issues is to get the landowners on board to work in partnership which in turn is great for the public but is good as a whole in terms of the country's health and wider wellbeing."Image source, BBC/Claire MarshallImage caption, Andrew Stumpf works with other volunteers, and landowners, in Monmouthshire to repair local rights of wayIn Wales, the government said it was funding a three-year ¬£5.6m grant to help councils and national park authorities improve and maintain public rights of way.One of those councils is Monmouthshire County Council, which is leading the way in working with landowners and walkers to protect and repair footpaths.It also works with volunteer groups of walkers to ensure problems are reported to its online mapping system as soon as possible.As a result, it received more than 15,000 reports of issues last year but says it only has 181 'live' footpath problems that it currently has to deal with on its 1,031-mile (1,659km) networkWe met Andrew Stumpf, a volunteer with The Ramblers Cymru, in Grosmont. He leads a group of fellow local walkers as they stomp through a boggy field, shoulders heavy with spades, and a wooden post. They are off to replace a rotten waymarker, with the landowners' permission. The kit and training is paid for by Monmouthshire County Council; the volunteers provide the labour."They supply us with the materials and the training expertise," explains Mr Stumpf. "And they come out and help us to do the more complicated stuff. It means from their perspective that it's being done to the right standard. "It works for us, because we're doing healthy activity, and we're getting more paths that we can actually enjoy."Related TopicsRural lifeMore on this story'People power' gets popular footpath reopenedPublished12 December 2023Footpath work to be costed and prioritisedPublished23 June 2023Who really has access to the countryside?Published24 July 2022View commentsTop StoriesLive.

Just five years ago its motor industry shipped only a quarter as many cars as Japan, then the world‚Äôs biggest exporter. This week the Chinese industry claimed to have exported more than 5m cars in 2023, exceeding the Japanese total. By 2030 China could double its share of the global market to a third, ending the dominance of the West‚Äôs national champions, especially in Europe.In the leader we wanted to focus on the reaction this is likely to provoke in the West. The ‚ÄúChina shock‚Äù, when about 1m American manufacturing workers lost their jobs to Chinese competition, has been blamed for everything from rising deaths among working-class Americans to the election of Donald Trump. It is also one of the reasons politicians enthusiastically embrace industrial policy today. The brief for our cover designers was to capture both sides of this story‚ÄîChina‚Äôs emergence, as well as the fear that the West is about to undergo a second China shock.Inevitably, we began with pandas. An early sketch showed one of our furry friends lounging on the stripped-down chassis of an EV. Some of us loved this, but others remained confused. The problem is that it tells only half the story‚Äîthat Chinese companies have made this technology their own. If anything, our cuddly panda obscures the reality of a looming trade war.Our next idea was more aggressive. It showed a dragon with a tyre-track for a body‚Äîa detail some of us missed. When we worked up the final design we therefore added more texture to the tracks and the logos of some of the European marques likely to suffer. This cover also divided opinion. Some found it messy, others refreshingly vivid. Our reservation was that, by portraying a predator, we appeared to be endorsing the wild fears of Western politicians. In fact, our leader argues that value-for-money Chinese imports could bring great economic and environmental benefits.In the end we decided to use hyperbole to get that message across. A fleet of EVs invading from orbit is so over the top that readers should understand the irony. Many people will complain about the onrush of cars from China. But if Xi Jinping wants to spend taxpayers‚Äô money subsidising global consumers and speeding up the energy transition, the best response is to welcome it.Leaders: An influx of Chinese cars is terrifying the WestBriefing: Western firms are quaking as China‚Äôs electric-car industry speeds upFinance and economics: Xi Jinping risks setting off another trade warOur second cover was about sea power. In the Red Sea this week America and Britain hit back against Houthi militias, who have launched dozens of attacks on ships with drones and missiles, cutting container activity in the Suez Canal by 90%. The Black Sea is filling up with mines and crippled warships. The Baltic and North seas face a shadow-war of pipeline and cable sabotage. And amid tensions over Taiwan, Asia is seeing the largest build-up of naval power since the second world war.To illustrate this, we thought about using several photographs. One showed a convoy of destroyers on exercises in the South China Sea‚Äîan impressive sight. Another we considered was a moody shot of a warship silhouetted by the setting sun.However, our message is that superpower rivalry and the decay of global rules and norms are deepening geopolitical tensions. We thought we could do better.To convey that this drama is being played out at sea, we decided to turn the ocean into a giant chessboard. It is easy to identify where conflict could break out. Attacks by, say, Iran or Russia on pipelines, liquefied-natural-gas routes or data cables could be crippling. Spats over strategic islands could trigger confrontation in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean. And embargoes of economies more sophisticated than Russia‚Äôs or Iran‚Äôs could do enormous damage. A simulation by Bloomberg shows a blockade of Taiwan and Western countermeasures might cut global GDP by 5%.We agreed on a design which showed the bow wave from the naval ship distorting the black and white squares of the chessboard. But there was a problem. The vessel we were using in our sketches‚Äîa Freedom Class Littoral Combat Ship‚Äîwas so plagued with design and operational snafus that it became known as the Little Crappy Ship. It was hardly the emblem to herald a mighty new era of sea power. So for our final design decommissioned the LCS and procured an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer instead. To illustrate the dangerous waters that lie ahead, we relied on the workhorse of the US Navy.Leaders: Mayday!

Ashford MP Damian Green said a similar model to football should be adopted, where a levy is imposed and money from the Premier League trickles down to grassroots clubs. Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine also warned that the music industry will not have ‚Äúthe Elton Johns and the Queens and the Taylor Swifts‚Äù of the future without preserving smaller venues. The UK Government said ¬£5m had been put into the Supporting Grassroots Music fund, but added there was scope for the industry to lead a solution on the issue. Speaking during Commons culture media and sport questions on Thursday, Green said: ‚ÄúAcross the country ‚Ä¶ in 2023 live music boomed, 22 million people attended gigs, and yet 76 small venues closed; more than one a week. ‚ÄúSo I draw her [the culture minister‚Äôs] attention to the analogy with another hugely successful leisure industry, football, where a small amount of the enormous riches gained by the Premier League actually is allowed to trickle down to the grassroots so that the future of the sport is preserved. ‚ÄúJust as in that we have hugely profitable large arenas, where the superstars of today perform, and create huge revenues, a levy on the tickets from those sorts of shows ‚Ä¶ would actually help the small venues produce the superstars of tomorrow.‚Äù Culture Minister Julia Lopez replied: ‚ÄúWe agree with the importance of grassroots music and that is why we have given another ¬£5m to the Supporting Grassroots Music fund, but we are also in touch with the Music Venue Trust. ‚ÄúThey have a great initiative - Own Our Venues - where the Arts Council is supporting buying some of the freehold of grassroots music venues. ‚ÄúAgain, we support that, but we think there is a larger amount of scope for the industry to lead a solution in this area, and we are supporting talks between different parts of that industry.‚Äù Jardine said her constituency of Edinburgh West benefits from a ‚Äúplethora of small venues‚Äù, which depend on the Edinburgh Festival to survive. She added: ‚ÄúBut we recognise that those small venues which the Music Venue Trust says 10% currently struggle to survive and depend on grants from them don‚Äôt get any benefit from those big gigs ‚Äì would the government consider a levy in some way to support those gigs? ‚ÄúBecause without those smaller venues, we will never have the Elton Johns and the Queens and the Taylor Swifts who use those smaller venues to learn their craft, develop and benefit our economy and culture.‚Äù Lopez agreed that ‚Äúgrassroots venues are the talent incubators of the music industry‚Äù, adding that ministers were speaking to the music industry about a solution. ‚ÄúWe think it is probably best for industry to do that, rather than mandate it as a government.‚Äù Later in the debate, Labour former minister John Spellar said artificial intelligence (AI) should be used to protect the work of ‚Äúworld-leading creative talent‚Äù. The MP for Warley said: ‚ÄúIn the media world content is key, and that is why we must support our world-leading creative talent, so will she [Lucy Frazer] take steps to require AI developers to provide songwriters and composers with detailed information as to how their works are being used?‚Äù Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer agreed on the ‚Äúimportance of protecting the creative original work of the creative industries‚Äù, adding that she is liaising with the Intellectual Property Office on the issue. Meanwhile, SNP MP Patrick Grady argued orchestras‚Äô ability to tour in Europe is ‚Äúbeing sacrificed on the altar of Brexit fundamentalism‚Äù. The Glasgow North MP told the Commons: ‚ÄúThe Association of British Orchestras has warned that the removal of tax credits for performances in the European Economic Area is a direct result of Brexit and it could make touring in Europe for orchestras unviable.‚Äù Responding, Lopez said: ‚ÄúUnlike the SNP we actually listen to what people say at referenda, so I‚Äôm afraid we are not going to be rejoining the EU, and that will, therefore, mean that we cannot have special tax privileges on that basis. ‚ÄúBut DCMS is aware of the concerns of the touring orchestras and we are facilitating discussions with HMRC so they know precisely where they stand on some of the issues that they have raised on this matter.‚Äù Addressing the wider issue of musicians touring in Europe, she said: ‚ÄúWe have engaged with the EU and member states to clarify guidance and where possible improve arrangements when it comes to EU touring. ‚ÄúThe vast majority of EU member states - 23 of the 27 - offer visa- and permit-free routes for touring. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always looking at what more we can do and that includes the music export growth scheme which has tripled to ¬£3.2m over the next two years.‚Äù The Music Venue Trust said it agreed with ministers that creating a levy to fund small venues is needed, but its chief executive Mark Davyd said: ‚ÄúRegrettably we increasingly seem to be in a minority in the music industry itself in believing that such a voluntary levy can actually be achieved.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúIn the absence of any will or action to deliver the funding that grassroots venues and artists desperately need, we are therefore reluctantly forced to conclude that the government may have to act to impose a levy such as the one that has been legally mandated in France. ‚ÄúIt seems absurd that a British artist playing for a British agent and a British promoter in a French arena is donating 3.5% of the cover price of the ticket into a fund to support the development of French artists and French venues, but the same artist performing for the same agents and same promoters in the UK makes no financial contribution towards the development of British talent. ‚ÄúThat has to change, and, if it cannot be changed voluntarily, then unfortunately the government may have to act to make it a legal requirement.‚Äù Don't miss the latest headlines with our twice-daily newsletter -sign up here for free.

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.As with every skirmish in America‚Äôs culture wars, how you view the ousting of Harvard University‚Äôs president has much to do with where you are sitting. Claudine Gay resigned on January 2nd. Progressives see her as a competent administrator who, as Harvard‚Äôs first black president, was subjected to a smear campaign. Conservatives, meanwhile, spy a plagiarist who failed to quash antisemitism on campus. Naturally, your columnist‚Äîperched at a Bloomberg terminal‚Äîviews the episode in its true light: as a blood-on-the-carpet coup by an experienced activist investor, disposing of an errant chief executive.The investor in question is Bill Ackman, one of Wall Street‚Äôs more outspoken hedge-fund bosses. He is also one of Harvard‚Äôs more generous donors, having given it $50m. And he has spent recent months on the warpath, berating the university for failing to protect Jewish students from antisemitic attacks.Then came a congressional hearing in which Ms Gay and two other university presidents prevaricated over whether calling for a genocide of Jews would violate their institutions‚Äô codes of conduct. ‚ÄúThe world will be able to judge the relative quality of the governance‚Äù at the three schools, Mr Ackman wrote, ‚Äúby the comparative speed with which their boards fire their respective presidents.‚Äù A month on, two of the three are gone.Although Mr Ackman‚Äôs fund prefers ‚Äúquiet, constructive engagements‚Äù with the companies it owns, he made his name as a fearsome boardroom brawler. Over the years he has picked high-profile fights with America‚Äôs Municipal Bond Insurance Association, the Canadian Pacific railway and Target, a retail giant. Unsurprisingly, then, his most recent campaign bore all the hallmarks of a veteran activist heading into battle‚Äîand carries lessons for how to win one.First, and most important, make sure you are in good company. Mr Ackman was just one of many to go after Ms Gay, making the tactics of a successful campaign much easier to deploy. The obvious one is financial pressure: Mr Ackman says he is aware of $1bn-worth of donations being withheld from the university since October 7th. That sort of firepower is a lot easier to muster if you are acting in concert with others. Think of the pack of hedge-fund managers George Soros assembled to short the pound in the 1990s.Strength in numbers also made the second line of attack‚Äîforensic analysis of the opponent‚Äîmore deadly. Activist short-sellers (a group that once included Mr Ackman) obsessively comb through their targets‚Äô accounts; one of them, Carson Block, talks of reading many years of call transcripts, starting with the oldest. In the Harvard mess it was Mr Ackman‚Äôs fellow travellers, such as Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist, who trawled through Ms Gay‚Äôs work to find lines apparently copied from others without attribution. It was ultimately these accusations of plagiarism that toppled her. While others reviewed the documents, Mr Ackman was freed up to do his own due diligence, meeting hundreds of Harvard students and faculty members to establish how insiders viewed events.No amount of allies, though, can help with the third requirement for an activist campaign: bloody-mindedness. Whatever the target, they are unlikely to be broken by the initial salvo‚Äîand may fire back. In 2021 Andrew Left, another short-seller, decided to quit the scene after furious meme-stock investors sent threatening messages to his children. Sure enough, Mr Ackman is now embroiled in a much bigger feud. On January 4th Business Insider, a news site, accused his wife, a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, of a ‚Äúsimilar pattern of plagiarism‚Äù to Ms Gay‚Äôs. Suspecting the allegation came from MIT, Mr Ackman responded by promising a plagiarism review of everything published by the university‚Äôs president, board and faculty.For all its admirable chutzpah, the escalation points to danger ahead. Mr Ackman began by trying to combat antisemitism at Harvard by unseating a president who seemed soft on it. He now appears to be gearing up for a fight with much of America‚Äôs academic establishment over plagiarism, diversity policies and the future path of higher education. This scope may seem plausible to a man who rose to prominence by shorting the American mortgage market. Yet the best activist campaigns have specific aims and endpoints‚Äîand tend not to be fought against people with tenure.

In a seven-page submission, the industry body has published a detailed response to what it described as a ‚Äúmuddled‚Äù Budget for 2024-25. David Lonsdale, director of the SRC, said the announcements were particularly disappointing given the ‚Äúlow ebb‚Äù of retail sales in recent years. The consortium previously criticised Scottish Government ministers for failing to plug the estimated ¬£1bn deficit through cuts to government costs amid expanding civil service numbers. Instead, the SRC has argued the buck is being passed to retailers as the freeze to the basic property rate falls to medium and larger commercial properties. Deputy First Minister Shona Robison announced the poundage on the basic property rate would be frozen for small businesses with a value up to ¬£51,000. The SRC analysis estimates 22,120 commercial premises - including 4,550 retailers - will have to pay considerably more from April; a 6.7% rise. ‚ÄúIt puts added pressure on those retailers striving to trade profitably and pushes up the cost investments which stores up problems for the future,‚Äù the analysis said. ‚ÄúAn uplift of this magnitude is at odds with the Scottish Government‚Äôs pledge to ‚Äòuse business rates to boost business‚Äô ‚Äì it could undermine efforts at high street and town centre rejuvenation.‚Äù The SRC also raised alarm that retailers will fear future ‚Äúcash grabs‚Äù from ministers in the coming years as the government considers reviving the Public Health Supplement ‚Äì a levy on large stores selling alcohol or tobacco. The report brands the proposals a ‚Äúrecipe for self-inflicted economic harm‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúA new levy smacks of incoherent policy-making within government.‚Äù Lonsdale said the ‚Äúoblique, unclear and not-consulted-upon threat‚Äù would be a ‚Äúretrograde step‚Äù at odds with the New Deal for Business. He said: ‚ÄúGrocers, who already face expensive regulatory interventions on alcohol, high fat, salt and sugar foods and the troubled deposit return scheme, now face an additional tax ‚Äì one which even the Scottish Government admits is nothing more than a cash grab. ‚ÄúThe combination of new taxes, increasing business rates, and cuts to skills funding makes it hard to discern a coherent plan to grow the Scottish economy in this muddled Budget ‚Äì Scotland‚Äôs economy isn‚Äôt in great shape and the Budget seems set to make things more challenging.‚Äù Liz Smith, Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no wonder the SRC are concerned by this disastrous Budget, which might have been designed to stymie growth and hammer retail businesses. ‚ÄúThanks to the SNP‚Äôs failure to pass on the funding support for business rates, quarter of a million Scottish workers and 4,500 shops are disadvantaged compared with the rest of the UK. ‚ÄúHigher Scotland-only taxes, both for individuals and retailers, are further punitive measures that will hinder employment, investment and competitiveness. ‚ÄúThe SNP‚Äôs constant imposition of more costs and regulations, rather than addressing their own over-spending and mismanagement, makes a nonsense of their claims to be listening to business.‚Äù The Scottish Government has been asked for comment.

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Central America is a laboratory for systems of government, few of them good. The likes of Costa Rica and Panama have real if messy democracies. Nicaragua suffers under Daniel Ortega, a dictator, and El Salvador is becoming more autocratic under a populist strongman, Nayib Bukele. Honduras and Guatemala have been deeply corrupt. Hence the enthusiasm for Bernardo Ar√©valo, a bona fide democrat, who is to be sworn in as Guatemala‚Äôs president on January 14th.A 65-year-old former academic and ambassador to Spain, Mr Ar√©valo pledges to restore democracy, which has long been ailing in Central America‚Äôs most populous country. Mr Ar√©valo and his party, Semilla, have made a range of promises that broadly fall into two baskets: cleaning up the state to make it more democratic and inclusive; and improving services, such as education, health care and infrastructure.Many pundits hope that Guatemala can set a new trend, in contrast to the likes of Mr Bukele, who is easily Latin America‚Äôs most popular politician and role model. Mr Ar√©valo has had an outpouring of support, both at home and abroad. Civil society, led by the country‚Äôs large indigenous population, took to the streets in the face of attempts by a political, military and judicial cabal known as ‚Äúthe pact of the corrupt‚Äù to stop Mr Ar√©valo from taking office. To prove himself Mr Ar√©valo will need to ‚Äúgo beyond good intentions‚Äù, says Edgar Gut√≠errez, a former foreign minister. ‚ÄúOur objective is to make the democratic model sufficiently attractive,‚Äù says Samuel P√©rez, a Semilla lawmaker. ‚ÄúThat means results to improve people‚Äôs lives.‚Äù But within his party some disagree over how much to compromise its ideals to get things done.Mr Ar√©valo will have to be pragmatic. Semilla won only 23 of 160 seats in Congress and will eschew corrupt practices of the past, such as handing lucrative contracts to its supporters. √Ålvaro Arz√∫, an opposition congressman, says there is room for negotiation to pass laws, for instance on health services. But many lawmakers will refuse to co-operate. Things in Guatemala are so dire that even small changes should make a difference. ‚ÄúThink filling in potholes rather than building a double-decker road,‚Äù suggests Edgar Ortiz of the Liberty and Development Foundation, a local think-tank. Alejandro Giammattei, the departing president, has strengthened presidential power, so Mr Ar√©valo can lean on executive fiat. He may need to be showy. Mr P√©rez points to the popularity of a new library in El Salvador‚Äîpaid for by China. Such things get noticed.Mr Ar√©valo is unlikely to match Mr Bukele‚Äôs popularity. His win in Guatemala was ‚Äúa glitch in the matrix‚Äù, says Mr Ortiz. He was lucky in the second-round vote to run against a candidate who had failed in three previous bids. The United States‚Äô support may be limited to anti-corruption. Mobilising the street will be harder once in office. ‚ÄúWe are not 100% behind Ar√©valo,‚Äú says Luis Pacheco, an indigenous leader. ‚ÄúThe idea was to defend our democracy and elections.‚Äù Lester Ram√≠rez, a Honduran researcher, says: ‚ÄúGuatemala‚Äôs democratic resilience is impressive. But there‚Äôs a social fatigue after the vote.‚Äù He reckons that people see election day as the moment to embrace democracy. But afterwards they just want results, however achieved, and thus often prefer a strongman.‚ñ†This article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline "Shiny new model?"The Americas January 13th 2024How Ecuador became Latin America‚Äôs deadliest countryThe dwindling of the Panama Canal boosts rival trade routesGuatemala‚Äôs new president promises a better sort of governmentFrom the January 13th 2024 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Explore the editionShareReuse this contentMore from The AmericasHow Ecuador became Latin America‚Äôs deadliest countryForty-eight hours of mayhem as gangsters murder prison guards and raid a TV stationThe dwindling of the Panama Canal boosts rival trade routesBut they may end up more complementary than competitiveWhy is Brazil a hotspot for financial crime?Its success as a fintech hub is mostly to blameSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentHelp and contact usKeep updatedLinkedInFacebookXInstagramThreadsTikTokYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in ‚Äúa severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.‚Äù The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist Impact EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesExecutive JobsTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Data RightsCopyright ¬© The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.

=====The Houthis have survived worse than America‚Äôs and Britain‚Äôs strikesThe EconomistThe EconomistSkip to contentMenuWeekly editionThe world in briefSearchLog inOpinionLeadersLetters to the editorBy InvitationCurrent topicsIsrael and HamasWar in UkraineUS elections 2024The World Ahead 2024Climate changeCoronavirusThe world economyThe Economist explainsArtificial intelligenceCurrent topicsIsrael and HamasWar in UkraineUS elections 2024The World Ahead 2024Climate changeCoronavirusThe world economyThe Economist explainsArtificial intelligenceWorldThe world this weekChinaUnited StatesEuropeBritainMiddle East & AfricaAsiaThe AmericasInternationalA-Z of international relationsA-Z of military termsIn depthScience & technologyGraphic detailSpecial reportsTechnology QuarterlyBriefingEssaySchools briefBusiness & economicsFinance & economicsBusinessBig Mac indexA-Z of economicsEconomic & financial indicatorsCulture & society1843 magazineCultureObituaryThe Economist readsChristmas SpecialsMorePodcastsNewslettersFilmsThe Economist appSubscriber eventsEconomist Education coursesGroup subscriptionsIncluded in your subscriptionPodcastsNewslettersFilmsLive virtual eventsThe Economist appMy EconomistSaved storiesLog outSaved storiesAccountLog outSearchSearchMiddle East and Africa | Strikes in the Red SeaThe Houthis have survived worse than America‚Äôs and Britain‚Äôs strikesThe Iran-backed group has been hardened by its long war with Saudi Arabia image: Getty Images Jan 12th 2024 | DUBAIShareTHE HOUTHIS have an ambitious slogan: it includes ‚Äúdeath to America, death to Israel‚Äù. For decades, that was aspirational. The group was largely limited to fighting its fellow Yemenis and its neighbours on the Arabian peninsula. Yet since October, what was once a scrappy insurgency in desolate northern Yemen has managed to put itself in conflict with both the Middle East‚Äôs strongest power and the world‚Äôs superpower.Early on January 12th American and British warplanes bombed dozens of targets in Yemen. More allied strikes could take place. President Joe Biden said: ‚ÄúI will not hesitate to direct further measures.‚Äù The strikes followed almost two months of Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The group says these are a show of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, and that it is only targeting ships with links to Israel (it has also fired missiles at southern Israel). In practice, though, the attacks have been random, seeming to target any vessel that happens to be within range, including American and British warships. Most of the world‚Äôs leading container-shipping companies are now avoiding the Red Sea.Last month America stood up a multinational coalition to secure the waterway, and on January 3rd the coalition gave the Houthis a ‚Äúfinal warning‚Äù. They responded hours later by detonating a naval drone a few miles away from commercial vessels and American warships, following that up a week later with a barrage against an American carrier group and a British destroyer.The coalition had valid reason to strike the Houthis: freedom of navigation is a core tenet of international law. To do nothing would be to tolerate the blockade of a waterway that handles perhaps 30% of global container traffic. Hapag-Lloyd, a German container firm, welcomed the action: ‚ÄúThe strikes were needed to guarantee the freedom of navigation through a vital sea route.‚Äù Whether the strikes will be effective is another matter: the Houthis have proved resilient before.Once the instigators of a local Shia rebellion in northern Yemen, the Houthis swept south in 2014 amid the chaos that followed the overthrow of Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen‚Äôs longtime dictator, and seized most of the country‚Äôs big population centres. A Saudi-led coalition invaded in March 2015 to remove them from power and restore the internationally recognised government. At the time, Saudi officials thought they could wrap up the war in six weeks. It turned into a proxy war against Iran, and almost nine years later they are still trying to extract themselves from a quagmire.The kingdom fought mostly from above, and air strikes proved ineffective at dislodging the Houthis. It left the ground fighting to inept local partners. The United Arab Emirates had more success: it sent thousands of ground troops and trained militias. But it fought primarily in southern Yemen, where the Houthis never enjoyed much support to begin with.The Houthis for their part showed little concern for the cost of war. Yemen has often been described as the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crisis. The UN estimates that 223,000 people have died from hunger and lack of medical care since the war began. 80% of the population now lives in poverty. None of this bothered the Houthis, who stole food aid, imposed a raft of taxes to raise funds and relied on Iran for military support. They have maintained a long siege on the south-western city of Taiz, barring civilians from bringing in food and medicine‚Äîexactly as they accuse Israel of doing in Gaza.A group that emerged stronger from a nine-year war that killed thousands of its fighters and immiserated its country is unlikely to be deterred by a few targeted coalition raids. To be fair, America and its allies have narrower aims: they do not want to overthrow the Houthis, merely stop their attacks on shipping.America says that it struck more than 60 targets across 16 locations, using more than 100 precision-guided bombs. The targets included command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, production facilities and air-defence radar. Four British warplanes also hit two airfields used for launching drones and missiles. The Houthis said that there had been 73 strikes in total, killing five soldiers and injuring another six. These are likely to have degraded but not eliminated the Houthi arsenal.Over the last decade Iran has supplied the group with a diverse stockpile of anti-ship missiles, including the 800km-range Paveh. The Houthis now operate up to six different types of anti-ship cruise missiles and another six variants of anti-ship ballistic missiles, according to a study by Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank, though many of the latter are unproven. In addition to the missiles, the Houthis have also experimented with uncrewed surface vessels, or drone boats.It is unclear how much of this arsenal has survived the barrage. Western warnings and leaks in the press gave the Houthis weeks to disperse and conceal their weapons, many of which are relatively small and mobile. If a significant proportion were nonetheless destroyed, the Houthis may be forced to ration missile strikes, allowing a greater proportion to be intercepted by Western warships in the area and creating a safer environment for commercial shipping to get through.‚ÄúThe detailed results of the strikes are being assessed,‚Äù said the British Ministry of Defence in a statement, ‚Äúbut early indications are that the Houthis‚Äô ability to threaten merchant shipping has taken a blow.‚Äù The fact that the Behshad, an Iranian spy ship which was probably helping the Houthis with intelligence, left the Red Sea on January 10th, perhaps for fear of being targeted, will also be a setback to the group.On the other hand, if the arsenal remains largely intact, the Houthis will be able to continue as before‚Äîor to make good on their promise to expand the campaign. In the long-term, says Mr Hinz, the group will be able to replenish its stockpile by smuggling in new disassembled systems‚Äîanti-ship missiles can be taken apart relatively easily, unlike larger solid-fuelled ballistic missiles‚Äîand by refitting land-attack ballistic missiles for anti-ship use using local facilities and Iranian-supplied guidance kits.Iran will no doubt be happy to send more. Its long relationship with the Houthis has deepened since 2015: arming and training the group was an easy way for Iran to bloody arch-rival Saudi Arabia and gain a foothold on the Arabian peninsula. The past few months seem to validate that strategy. Iran could already harass shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, off its southern coast. Now, through the Houthis, it can paralyse another vital waterway. ‚ÄúThe Red Sea is even more useful to them, because they don‚Äôt have to do it directly,‚Äù says a diplomat from the Gulf. The Houthis have proven their worth to Iran, which will probably ensure more Iranian support.Conflict with the West could have other benefits for them. Their supposed blockade of Israel has already won them new admiration across the Arab world, tapping into pro-Palestinian sentiment at a time when Arab states are feckless bystanders to the war in Gaza. Being targeted by America, while anti-Americanism is running high because of Mr Biden‚Äôs support for Israel, will add to their popularity.It could also strengthen their hand in peace talks with Saudi Arabia. A few years ago the Saudis might have cheered Western strikes on the Houthis. Today they are in the awkward position of calling for calm, lest the group decide to expand its campaign by targeting Gulf states with missiles or drones (as they have done hundreds of times in the past). The events of the past two months will reinforce to the Saudis why they want to cut a deal and end their war‚Äîeven if it leaves the Houthis as the dominant force in Yemen.America does not want to be dragged into another long Middle Eastern conflict. The Houthis have no such qualms. They outlasted Mr Saleh, who fought a series of brutal counter-insurgency campaigns against them. They exhausted the Saudi-led coalition. And now they are no doubt pleased to have drawn America into its own open-ended operation. ‚ñ†ShareReuse this contentMore from Middle East and AfricaSouth Africa‚Äôs support for the Palestinian cause has deep rootsBut opportunism and politics also play a partCan satellite cities help solve Africa‚Äôs urbanisation challenges?Many have failed to live up the hypeIsrael has yet to destroy even half of Gaza‚Äôs tunnelsBut its forces may soon have to oversee a massive humanitarian operationSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentHelp and contact usKeep updatedLinkedInFacebookXInstagramThreadsTikTokYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in ‚Äúa severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.‚Äù The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist Impact EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesExecutive JobsTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Data RightsCopyright ¬© The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.

=====Post Office may face ¬£100m tax bill over victim payouts - experts - BBC NewsBusinessMarket DataEconomyYour MoneyCompaniesTechnology of BusinessCEO SecretsArtificial IntelligencePost Office may face ¬£100m tax bill over victim payouts - expertsPublished1 hour agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsPost Office InquiryImage source, Getty ImagesBy Simon JackBusiness editorThe Post Office may have underpaid more than ¬£100m in tax while overpaying its senior executives, according to tax experts.Dan Neidle of Tax Policy Associates says the Post Office paid less tax by deducting payments to victims of the Horizon scandal from its profits.This could count as a possible breach of tax law, according to experts.The Post Office said its financial information was "appropriate and accurate".It has been paying out to sub-postmasters who have had their theft convictions quashed.Repaying the alleged shortfall to HMRC could render the Post Office technically insolvent and would involve the government stepping in to financially support it.However as the Post Office is owned by the government, exacting financial penalties is tantamount to the government fining itself and no-one is suggesting the Post Office will cease to function. Corporation tax is paid to the government by UK companies and foreign companies with UK offices.It is charged on their profits - the amount of money companies make, minus their costs such as staff and raw materials.While businesses can claim corporate tax deductions for legitimate business expenses, costs related to penalties or fines are not generally tax deductible.In this instance, the Post Office allegedly deducted the payments made to victims of the Horizon IT scandal from their revenue, resulting in a lower profit and therefore a lower tax bill. Can scheme to quash Post Office convictions work?PM backs calls to knight Post Office campaignerPost Office paid Fujitsu ¬£95m to extend HorizonMr Neidle said: "The non-deductibility of compensation for unlawful acts is a well-known point."Heather Self from accounting and advisory firm Blick Rothenberg agreed. "The payments of compensation by the Post Office are almost certainly not deductible for corporation tax purposes, in my view. Not only is it difficult to argue that they were incurred for trading purposes, there is also a general rule of public policy that fines - or payments in the nature of fines - are not deductible." The BBC understands that HMRC is investigating the way that the Post Office has accounted for the compensation payments and provisions. In its most recently published financial accounts, the risk of a significant adverse tax ruling is acknowledged.Notes to the accounts include the following: "As at the balance sheet date the company was engaged in discussions with HMRC regarding potential taxation liabilities that could arise in relation to past events but for which no liability has currently been recognised". It continues "the Directors recognise that an adverse outcome could be material".Mr Neidle estimates that deducting postmaster compensation from the Post Office's trading profit would mean that it underpaid more than ¬£100m in corporation tax. The Post Office does not currently have enough money to pay that bill and would therefore, Mr Neidle argues, be technically insolvent.A spokesman said that HMRC could not comment on specific business or individuals but said: "We collect the tax due under the law, creating a level playing field for everyone and funding public services." The Post Office said its financial information was "appropriate and accurate" and it was in discussions with HMRC and the Department for Business and Trade, which oversees the state-owned company.Executive payWhile the Post Office appears to have deducted compensation provisions from their taxable profits, it apparently ignored them when it came to calculating executive pay. The largest determinant of bosses' pay is a measure the Post Office calls "trading profit", which excludes the money set aside to compensate scandal victims, thereby increasing the pay of executives. Chief executive Nick Read received a salary of ¬£436,000 in the year ended 2022, plus a bonus of ¬£137,000, as the Post Office was deemed to have recorded an above target trading profit if compensation provisions were ignored. Mr Neidle said: "Bonuses have been paid to the executive team based on an apparent level of profitability which does not exist. If a public company missed an obvious tax point that made the business insolvent the shareholders would be demanding the CFO and CEOs head on a platter".Related TopicsPost Office InquiryPost Office LtdMore on this storyHow do the Post Office compensation schemes work?Published1 day agoCan scheme to quash Post Office convictions work?Published2 days agoTop StoriesLive.

=====Tony Blair was warned Horizon IT system could be flawed, documents show - BBC NewsPoliticsParliamentsBrexitTony Blair was warned Horizon IT system could be flawed, documents showPublished6 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsPost Office InquiryImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sir Tony Blair was Labour prime minister between 1997 and 2007By Helen CattPolitical correspondentSir Tony Blair was warned the Horizon IT system at the centre of the Post Office scandal could be flawed before it was rolled out, a document shows.A handwritten note from the then-Labour PM, published by the public inquiry on Friday, suggests he raised concerns after being warned the system was "possibly unreliable".But he said he gave it the go-ahead after being reassured by others. Among them was Peter Mandelson, who was then his trade and industry secretary. There was no indication at this stage that the Horizon software would lead to wrongful accusations of theft but there were concerns about its reliability and ballooning cost.In a letter dated 10 December 1998, Lord Mandelson said he believed the "only sensible choice" was to proceed with Horizon.He warned that cancelling the contract would cause "political fallout" from post office closures and damage relations with Fujitsu, which he described as a major investor in the UK. The letter, and the submission to Sir Tony, were both previously shown in hearings at the inquiry, which was launched in 2021, but have now been published in full.In 1998 Horizon was being developed by a firm called ICL, owned by Fujitsu, as a way of paying welfare benefits through Post Office counters using a swipe card. Ultimately this element of the project was dropped and the system was rolled out in 1999 for tasks like accounting and stocktaking instead. More than 900 workers were prosecuted after the faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.Why were hundreds of Post Office workers prosecuted?Fujitsu won Foreign Office contract despite concernsThe Horizon project, which was launched under John Major's Conservative government, was running more than two years behind schedule by 1998. The project was referred up to Sir Tony to decide if it should continue. 'Hugely expensive'A submission sent to the then-prime minister on 9 December 1998 by a special adviser at Downing Street, Geoff Mulgan, described the system as "increasingly flawed". Mr Mulgan warned that "in the long-run" it would "prove unsatisfactory" and described it as "hugely expensive, inflexible, inappropriate and possibly unreliable". Mr Blair jotted a handwritten note on the document that asked for a "clear view" on its reliability.On 14 December 1998, his private secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood wrote to Mr Mulgan to say that the prime minister's "clear preference would be to avoid cancelling the project". Witness statements given by other former Labour ministers, including Alistair Darling and Stephen Byers, previously set out how the government came up with a number of options to save the ailing scheme.In his own witness statement, given to the inquiry in 2022, Sir Tony pointed to a letter from Lord Mandelson written on 10 December 1998 as an example of the reassurance he had received.In the letter, Lord Mandelson said "the basic development work has been thoroughly evaluated by independent experts who have pronounced it viable, robust and of a design which should accommodate future technological developments". 'Naturally concerned'No former minister has said in their evidence to the inquiry that they knew of specific problems which led to sub-postmasters being wrongly accused of theft.Lord Mandelson's letter also warned that if the government cancelled the contract "our relations with Fujitsu, a major inward investor into the UK over the past decade, would be severely damaged, as would the credibility" of Private Finance Initiatives or PFIs - then a new method of funding major projects. In September 1998, Fujitsu announced it was closing a semiconductor plant in Sir Tony's Sedgefield constituency in County Durham, with the loss of 600 jobs. In his witness statement, Sir Tony said he was "naturally concerned" about the impact of the closure and it was mentioned by him in passing in a letter to the chairman of Fujitsu. However, he said he did not recall this being relevant to the matters being considered by the inquiry. Lord Mandelson's letter, which was sent to the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Byers and copied to the prime minister, also reflected concerns the system was vital for generating the footfall needed to keep post offices open.He wrote that "the damage to the confidence of sub-postmasters and the knock-on effect of network closures", which he said would come from cancelling Horizon, "will produce political fallout, no matter how carefully we try to handle it".Lord Mandelson's office has been approached for comment. A spokesperson for Sir Tony said: "As the documents show, and make completely clear, Mr Blair took the issue very seriously. His response to the Mulgan note, and in other interactions, was to raise the issue of the viability and reliability of the end project as this was his overarching concern. He subsequently received these reassurances. "It is now clear that the Horizon product was seriously flawed, leading to tragic and completely unacceptable consequences, and he has deep sympathy with all those affected."Related TopicsTony BlairPost Office InquiryPost Office LtdPost officesMore on this storyFujitsu won Foreign Office contract despite concernsPublished9 hours agoPostmasters could see convictions quashed this yearPublished1 day agoFujitsu should pay compensation, says postmasterPublished2 days agoLib Dems told what to say on Davey Post Office rolePublished2 days agoWhy were hundreds of Post Office workers prosecuted?Published1 day agoTop StoriesLive.

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.An old story, pointed if apocryphal, had the late Henry Kissinger complaining, ‚ÄúWho do I call if I want to call Europe?‚Äù In fact, for long periods of time (admittedly after Kissinger had left government), there was a good answer. During most of the 1980s and 1990s it was Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and from 2005 till the end of 2021, it was Angela Merkel. So large, rich and generally weighty is Germany that nothing important happens in Europe unless its chancellor wants it to, and what the chancellor wants, she or he usually gets. Until now.A Google search reveals that the leader of Germany is a man called Olaf Scholz, but so colourless and unimpressive a figure does he cut that you would be forgiven for not knowing it. While the European economy stagnates, the hard right climbs in the opinion polls almost everywhere and Vladimir Putin‚Äôs rockets rain down on Ukraine, a candidate member of the European Union, Mr Scholz is all but invisible. His Social Democrats are only the third-most popular party in Germany, with a derisory 15% level of support. Most of his time has to be spent propping up his rickety three-way coalition.This distracted impotence matters far beyond Germany. The EU has been left leaderless by Mr Scholz‚Äôs absence. Germany has to be the driver, whether raising cash for Ukraine, fixing migration problems, building the capital-markets union, reforming the system so that Ukraine and others can be admitted, or preparing Europe for all that a Trump victory in November would entail. Mr Kohl and Mrs Merkel knew this, and travelled and negotiated ceaselessly. Europe prospered as a result. That idea seems completely alien to the taciturn Mr Scholz, a solid supporter of Ukraine who has failed to inspire others.Obviously, it is not all up to the chancellor. The vital adjunct to a strong Germany is a strong France. Yet Emmanuel Macron, Mr Scholz‚Äôs counterpart, has become widely disliked at home; he lost his parliamentary majority in 2022, and struggles to get legislation passed. This week he sacked his prime minister, as beleaguered French presidents are wont to do, and appointed Gabriel Attal, a charismatic but under-experienced 34-year-old. In the past Mr Macron was a champion of reform, but these days his ability to influence Europe is diminished.More crucially, Mr Scholz and Mr Macron are said by insiders to get on badly, partly because their personalities are so different, but also because they have irreconcilable views. Mr Macron favours more European-level spending, more independence from NATO and America and a dirigiste economic policy, yet the flinty Mr Scholz agrees with none of that. Differences of outlook can be productive if there is a willingness to work together; but there isn‚Äôt.The news is not uniformly awful. Although the Franco-German motor that used to run Europe is broken, a few auxiliary mechanisms are still firing. One is the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, a rather more effective German than Mr Scholz, and one who deserves reappointment in the autumn. She has used her position well, arguing for and making good use of a ‚Ç¨800bn ($875bn) covid-recovery fund; but her powers are limited and she is no Jacques Delors, who united European leaders to build the single market and single currency. Another motive force is Donald Tusk, Poland‚Äôs new prime minister and a former president of the European Council. Unfortunately, he will be busy attempting to gain control at home.Even if Joe Biden wins in November, America is pulling back from its role as Europe‚Äôs main source of security. Europe is going to have to spend and do more to keep its citizens safe. Yet instead of rising to the challenge, Europe‚Äôs leaders are looking inward. ‚ñ†Explore moreGermanyThis article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline "The hole at the heart of Europe"Leaders January 13th 2024An influx of Chinese cars is terrifying the WestAmerica fights backWhy Olaf Scholz is no Angela MerkelHow to cut through the cacophony over DEI‚ÄúNo-strings giving‚Äù is transforming philanthropyFrom the January 13th 2024 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Explore the editionShareReuse this contentMore from LeadersAmerica fights backThe war against the Houthis is part of an escalating struggle for the seasHow to cut through the cacophony over DEIOutrage on right and left obscures both the costs of DEI and the benefits of diversityAn influx of Chinese cars is terrifying the WestBut it should keep its markets open to cheap, clean vehiclesSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentHelp and contact usKeep updatedLinkedInFacebookXInstagramThreadsTikTokYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in ‚Äúa severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.‚Äù The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist Impact EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesExecutive JobsTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Data RightsCopyright ¬© The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.

Images: Zuma Press/AFP/Getty Images Composite: Mark KellyThe press is reporting that Thursday‚Äôs U.S.-British strikes against the Houthis in Yemen risk escalating the current conflict in the Middle East. That‚Äôs the wrong way to think about it. The conflict was already escalating. The question has been whether the U.S. and its allies would respond to Houthi efforts, backed by Iran, to hijack commercial shipping and shoot at the U.S. Navy.President Biden‚Äôs patience, and his own fear of escalation, ran out Thursday night as U.S. and British forces hit more than 60 targets across 16 locations with more than 100 precision-guided munitions. The Houthis have been using these weapons depots, radars and launch sites to ‚Äúendanger freedom of navigation in one of the world‚Äôs most vital waterways,‚Äù as the White House said in a statement.

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.A DECADE AGO Xi Jinping, China‚Äôs leader, declared his intention to make a world-girdling web of infrastructure China‚Äôs gift to the planet. From the start, South-East Asia was to serve as a‚Äîperhaps the‚Äîmain focus of what came to be called the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The region of 690m people was China‚Äôs backyard. South-East Asia needed trillions of dollars of infrastructure and other development. China-centred supply chains increasingly ran through the ten-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Some 60m-70m ethnic-Chinese citizens of South-East Asia, many of them successful businessmen, could help China‚Äôs mission.Ten years on, there is no missing the wave of Chinese money that has broken over the region, bringing giant earth-moving machines, Chinese construction crews, Chinese business folk and diplomats, and not a few criminal chancers. Many BRI projects have gone well, bringing roads, railway tracks and power plants. In Cambodia, a new Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville expressway has cut the journey from the capital to the south coast from five hours to two.But others have provided poor returns. And a few have been grossly wasteful or environmentally damaging‚Äîor spread corruption among local elites, and even opportunities for Chinese criminal gangs. Malaysia, for example, has almost nothing to show for around $1.8bn it gave Chinese firms to build two pipelines in its state of Sabah; the project has been shelved.image: The EconomistAs the BRI wave recedes around the world, stories such as that can be found in many regions. Yet Chinese commitments in South-East Asia remain substantial, possibly amounting to more than $20bn last year. This leads to some striking conclusions, at least as far as the BRI‚Äôs critics in the West are concerned.First, though Mr Xi may have hoped Belt and Road would be a strategic means to further China‚Äôs influence in South-East Asia, no grand plan is apparent. Rather, Chinese state-owned firms suffering from overcapacity at home often rushed to make money in the region, with diverse results. Second, South-East Asian countries have not only grown more cautious over their commercial dealings with China, but also‚Äîat least in the case of larger countries‚Äîmore confident. Third, far from spurning fresh Chinese approaches, as some in the West hoped they would, many ASEAN members continue to welcome them. Yet they increasingly do so on terms more obviously beneficial to their own economies. They are also encouraging different sorts of Chinese investment. Infrastructure deals are flagging. Chinese investment in technology, renewable energy and electric vehicles is increasing.Measuring the extent of Belt and Road in South-East Asia is hard. At the height of Belt and Road frenzy, from 2015 to 2017, backers of almost any project with Chinese involvement labelled it BRI. Many were not centrally directed out of Beijing. Ong Kian Ming, a Malaysian former deputy minister, says a Chinese investment vehicle approached him in 2018, promising to fund any infrastructure project, so long as the contractor came from the firm‚Äôs province in China. ‚ÄúDiplomacy is an inaccurate way of looking at this‚Ä¶Nor was it premised on strong financial principles.‚ÄùMany of the projects announced never broke ground. Even so, China has lavished tens of billions of dollars in financial support, economic assistance and concessionary lending on South-East Asia in the past decade, with Indonesia getting the biggest share. On top of that come infrastructure and other investments on commercial terms‚Äîincluding most of the flagship BRI projects blessed by China‚Äôs central government. According to Maybank, a Malaysian bank, investment from China to South-East Asian commercial projects averaged $27.9bn a year between 2015 and 2019. It fell to less than $11bn in 2021, before recovering to $18.6bn in 2022. That post-pandemic recovery in asean contrasts with a continued slump in BRI investment elsewhere.Within asean, the record is mixed. Cambodia and impoverished Laos, small countries beholden to China, have embraced BRI most unquestioningly. Vietnam, long wary of its giant neighbour, has largely avoided it, preferring engagement through trade. In Indonesia President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, has used BRI to promote his own economic agenda, including a high-speed railway from Jakarta, the capital, to Bandung, and building a nickel-processing industry from scratch. The Philippines and Malaysia have had troubled engagements with BRI.Though the previous Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, welcomed BRI investments, they have done little for the country‚Äôs development, and brought in their wake a large illegal online-gambling industry dominated by Chinese expatriates. The current president, Ferdinand ‚ÄúBongbong‚Äù Marcos, has cancelled three BRI infrastructure projects and signed no new ones. As for Malaysia, its engagement with Belt and Road went awry when Chinese state banks and construction firms helped the corrupt then prime minister, Najib Razak, cover up his bilking of a Malaysian state investment vehicle, 1MDB, for which he is now jailed.Despite these intra-ASEAN differences, broad conclusions can be drawn, contradicting both the Belt and Road‚Äôs biggest boosters and its detractors. Certainly, the bigger the project, the bigger the risks. To political leaders, the advantage of BRI is no-strings investment and speed: quick access to Chinese finance, know-how and construction gangs. But large-scale projects require scrupulous management and risk analysis‚Äîwhich BRI does not come with. Jokowi‚Äôs high-speed train, cleverly branded as the Whoosh and opened late last year, was a pet presidential project that did not even feature in Indonesia‚Äôs transport master plan. Little was done in the way of impact assessments. At $7.3bn, the train ran wildly over budget. It will never pay for itself. In Cambodia and Laos, China-backed hydropower dams on the Mekong river are damaging a unique biome and imperilling the livelihoods of millions of fishers and farmers.Yet just as BRI projects reflect the agenda of local elites more than Chinese priorities, so BRI recipients retain leverage over China when projects hit the buffers. Take Malaysia‚Äôs East Coast Railway Line (ECRL), connecting its western ports with the relatively undeveloped east coast. Its initial cost, allegedly, was grossly inflated so that millions of dollars could be siphoned off to plug gaps in Mr Najib‚Äôs 1MDB. After his fall, says Malaysia‚Äôs transport minister, Anthony Loke, Malaysia successfully demanded that Chinese counterparts cut the project‚Äôs price by 30%, raise the involvement of Malaysian firms and share the risk by jointly running the ECRL once in operation.Bridges to batteriesWith the possible exception of Laos, which has loans to Chinese entities equivalent to 65% of GDP, talk of China pursuing ‚Äúdebt-trap diplomacy‚Äù in South-East Asia is exaggerated. Indeed, Chinese companies and banks are often pressed to renegotiate existing deals on less favourable terms. China has meanwhile quietly acknowledged that having too many dodgy projects has harmed its reputation. Even the term ‚ÄúBelt and Road‚Äù is now omitted from the signage of many Chinese-backed schemes.A decade‚Äôs experience of Belt and Road has made South-East Asian countries wary of criticising China in public. Neither can they easily criticise or cancel signature projects without incurring its wrath, including in the form of economic sanctions. As Tony Pua, a Malaysian former politician who served in the finance ministry, puts it: ‚ÄúWe cannot go out there and condemn China, because there‚Äôll quickly be no more Chinese tourists coming to Malaysia. We‚Äôll be screwed not just economically. We‚Äôll be screwed with our own ethnic-Chinese voters who are partial to China.‚Äù Yet South-East Asian countries increasingly do say no to deals they don‚Äôt like. They also seek investments that better reflect new priorities, such as climbing up the manufacturing value chain. Take Malaysia. Its government invited a Chinese carmaker, Geely, to turn around a struggling national carmaker, Proton, which recently agreed to a $10bn investment. It lured Huawei, China‚Äôs telecoms giant, to launch regional operations in the country. Chinese steel firms are setting up at industrial parks jointly managed by Malaysian and Chinese entities. Malaysia wants more Chinese investment in everything from e-commerce to renewable energy. Its ambition, says Yeah Kim Leng, an economist, is to be ASEAN‚Äôs main production hub.Other ASEAN members have similar hopes for Chinese involvement‚Äîincluding Indonesia in EVs and Thailand in renewable energy. Investments in such areas may not be labelled BRI. Still, a decade‚Äôs experience of it has not dimmed ASEAN‚Äôs appetite for co-operation with China. Contrary to what many China hawks maintain, the legacy of Belt and Road in South-East Asia looks to be deep and enduring. ‚ñ†Explore moreChinaThis article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline "Better Renegotiate It"Asia January 13th 2024South-East Asia learns how to deal with ChinaWomen‚Äôs (in)justice in IndiaIndia bridles at China‚Äôs growing presence in South AsiaBangladesh‚Äôs prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, wins a fifth termThe favourite in Indonesia‚Äôs presidential election has a sordid pastFrom the January 13th 2024 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Explore the editionShareReuse this contentMore from AsiaThe favourite in Indonesia‚Äôs presidential election has a sordid pastVictory for Prabowo Subianto would be a setback for reformasiWomen‚Äôs (in)justice in IndiaA new study shows how the justice system penalises womenIndia bridles at China‚Äôs growing presence in South AsiaA spat with the Maldives highlights regional difficultiesSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentHelp and contact usKeep updatedLinkedInFacebookXInstagramThreadsTikTokYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in ‚Äúa severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.‚Äù The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist Impact EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesExecutive JobsTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Data RightsCopyright ¬© The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.

=====Why is the world investing so much in semiconductors? - BBC NewsBusinessMarket DataEconomyYour MoneyCompaniesTechnology of BusinessCEO SecretsArtificial IntelligenceWhy is the world investing so much in semiconductors?Published1 day agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Pragmatic SemiconductorImage caption, Pragmatic Semiconductor are developing a big computer chip plant in DurhamBy Hannah MullaneBusiness Reporter, BBC NewsI'm at the UK's newest computer chip plant in Durham. Formerly a ceramic pipe factory, from the outside it looks like a big warehouse. But inside the vast space is being transformed into a sophisticated hub for the manufacturing of computer chips.Pragmatic Semiconductor has already built one production line, which the industry likes to call fabrication lines, or fab lines.Sealed off in its own large room, the production line has all the expensive machinery needed to make the computer chips, and the air inside is carefully controlled to avoid any contamination during production.Pragmatic has the money to build another such production line, and funding of ¬£182m ($230m) announced late last year will fund production lines three and four.As well as from private investors, Pragmatic secured funding from the government-backed UK Infrastructure Bank and British Patient Capital, a subsidiary of British Business Bank.But the Cambridge-based company will need much more money to complete its plan to build eight production lines in the old pipe factory. From phones and computers, to cars and washing machines, almost every product with an on-off switch relies on the production of computer chips, also known as semiconductors.It is an industry that has seen a lot of turbulence over the last few years. There's been disruption to supply chains during the pandemic, and geopolitical tensions in Asia, where 90% of the world's most advanced chips originate. Image source, Pragmatic SemiconductorImage caption, David Moore shows how Pragmatic chips bendDavid Moore, chief executive of Pragmatic Semiconductor, which is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the UK, says the industry is going to need multiple types of semiconductors to solve "different kinds of problems" in the chip sector.Most semiconductors are made using silicon, but his company is taking a different approach. They are making flexible chips - they actually bend - at their plant in Durham, which can be used in wearable technology, clothing authentication, and even in parcel labels to track and trace items.Rather than sitting on silicon wafer, Pragmatic's chips are built on a flexible thin film. This approach results in chips that are cheaper and faster to manufacture than the standard silicon chip. "If you take a standard silicon manufacturing facility, it's going to take multiple years and billions of dollars to make," Mr Moore said."Our fabrication plant can be 10 to 100 times cheaper depending on what you compare it with. "In silicon, it will take three to six months to go from the start of the process all the way to a finished wafer product. For us, we can do that in less than 48 hours."But it is no panacea. The flexible chip may be cheaper and quicker to make, but the advanced chips in phones, computers and other leading tech will still need the most advanced silicon-based computer chips.More technology of businessWhere will all the electric cars be charged?Can Denmark's world beating drugs maker stay ahead?Will hotter heat pumps win over homeowners?Tech Trends 2024: AI and electric vehicle dealsThe quest to find healthy and cheap sweetenersA serious shortage of those chips in 2021, underlined how dependent global industry is on a few key suppliers. In particular, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) makes 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors. In an effort to cut that dependency governments are spending huge sums to create stronger domestic chip industries.In August 2022, the US government signed into law the US Chips Act, which pledged $52bn (¬£41bn) to boost domestic production of computer chips.The European Union has its own project worth ‚Ç¨43bn (¬£37bn).On a smaller scale the UK has promised ¬£1bn of investment in the sector.Analysts says that the big chip manufacturers are responding to such government incentives.Germany has seen a huge wave of investment. A Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer has decided, together with three European headquartered companies, to invest ‚Ç¨10bn in Dresden."We see that 80% of of global production is currently in Asia, the reliance on Asian countries means we really need to strengthen our resilience here in the EU," notes Hendrik Abma, director general of the European Semiconductor Industry Association. "I think the realisation about the importance of semiconductors for industry here in Europe, for our technical development, has been underestimated in the past."As well as Germany, Mr Abma notes that Belgium, Lithuania and the Czech Republic, have seen significant investments.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, TSMC dominates the market for the most advanced computer chipsThe US is beating China in the battle for chipsEU seeks to supercharge computer chip productionFollowing the US Chips Act, almost 500 companies applied to the US government for funding for projects, according to Hannah Dohmen, research analyst at Georgetown's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology in Washington.Plants are planned in New York, Arizona, Texas, Ohio and Idaho, she says. And outside the US and Europe, other projects are planned."We're also seeing India attempt to enter the chip manufacturing space. A country that has a strong history in chip design but will be starting from scratch in manufacturing," Ms Dohmen added."India are looking to be a big player in the space, and with intensifying competition with China. This has prompted the US and other allied countries to strengthen tech cooperation with India."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Experts say that new chip plants might be a wasteful duplicationIt all sounds very positive but building computer chip plants is not easy.Plans by TSMC to build advanced chips in Arizona have run into trouble, with the company blaming a shortage of skilled workers. Others worry that the rush to build plants in Europe and the US, will just mirror what already exists in Asia. "There's a risk of duplication and wastefulness across the industry," Ms Dohmen said.Meanwhile, Mr Moore predicts more diversification in how semiconductors are made and what they're used for."You go from tens of billions of connected things to hundreds of billions and trillions of connected things, ultimately you end up with that very challenging element of not being able to supply to it, and so alternative supplies in high volume are what are going to be required."And being able to provide those cost effectively and at scale - that's the big challenge."Related TopicsTechnology of BusinessSemiconductorsTop StoriesLive.

=====The key NHS targets that have never been met - BBC NewsHealthThe key NHS targets that have never been metPublished1 day agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesBy Nick Triggle and Hugh PymBBC NewsMost key NHS targets have been missed for at least seven years across the UK, BBC News research shows.The review of records going back 20 years also reveals Northern Ireland and Wales have never met the four-hour accident-and-emergency (A&E) target.The analysis focused on the three key hospital targets, covering A&E, cancer and waiting times for planned care.Combined, the length of time during which the targets have been missed tops 100 years.In the past seven, the only one to have been met is the A&E target in Scotland - and that was during lockdown in 2020, when the number of visits to A&E plummeted. All four nations said improving waiting times was a priority and investment was being made.But in an exclusive interview with the BBC, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said not enough was being done.He highlighted the disproportionate number of children on the waiting list - and unveiled a new pledge that no child will wait longer than the target time of 18 weeks for hospital treatment if he were elected prime minister.He said it was "shocking" that so many children - more than 180,000 - were waiting longer than 18 weeks."Most people across the country would assume children are the priority. Long waits impair their mental and physical development," Sir Keir added.Currently there is no separate target for children and to hit the overall target 92% of patients need to be seen in 18 weeks.Sir Keir said under his plan there would be no wriggle room.The comments came as Labour unveiled its child health action plan with the vision of creating the "healthiest generation of children ever".To ensure this happens, the party has proposed a ban on junk food advertising, more breakfast clubs in primary schools and supervised teeth-brushing for young children.'Wake-up call'King's Fund think tank chief analyst Siva Anandaciva said the findings of the BBC analysis should "act as a wake-up call"."These are the key totemic targets," he said. "The length of time they have been missed is incredible."Patients groups warned the delays were putting patients at risk.Patients Association chief executive Rachel Power said the analysis showed the NHS was in "permacrisis"."The health of many deteriorates while they await treatment and their problems become more complex," she said. How are your local NHS services coping this winter? Enter a postcode to find out. Eg ‚ÄòB1 1RF‚Äô Last updated: Thursday 11 January About the data About the data Data for England is shown by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. Data for Wales and Scotland is shown by Health Board and in Northern Ireland by Health and Social Care Trust. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board and by Health and Social Care trust in Northern Ireland. Comparative data is shown for a previous year where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Earlier data is not available for all measures, so comparisons between years are not always possible. In England and Northern Ireland A&E attendances include all emergency departments in that trust or health board, not just major A&E departments. For example, those who attend minor injury units are included. In Wales the data include all emergency departments, but does not include patients kept in A&E by doctors under special circumstances, [more details here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-67056279). In Scotland the data includes only major A&E departments. Each nation has different target times and definitions for some of the measures shown, therefore comparisons between them are not possible. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive. Kate Seymour, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: "The impact this is having on people living with cancer, their families and friends is nothing short of heartbreaking. They deserve better." British Medical Association leader Prof Philip Banfield said the figures showed the "dire decline" of the NHS during the years of austerity. Services were "stretched beyond their limits" across the UK, he said."Front-line staff are unable to provide the care they've trained so hard to undertake and that patients so desperately need," Prof Banfield added.Can the NHS survive to 100?The NHS backlog: Who are the 7 million?'Worst time of my life'Whether waiting in A&E or for cancer care to begin or an operation, the impact of significant delays on patients is immense.Ian Binns waited four months for cancer treatment for bowel cancer - twice as long as he should have.During this time the 66-year-old, from Nottingham, went from stage one to late stage four.He described the wait as the "worst time of my life"."I would wake up every morning wondering if I had a future."Image source, OtherImage caption, Ian Binns waited four months for cancer treatment- twice as long as he should haveHis cancer is now incurable as it has spread. "Our greatest tools are rapid diagnosis and timely treatment. Where was the help when I needed it?"David Corbitt's wait did not have such a devastating effect.But he still described the experience as awful when he went to A&E because of concerns over a potential heart problem.He was advised by an out-of-hours GP to seek help after feeling unwell - he was light-headed and was struggling with his coordination.The 66-year-old, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, got a friend to drive him straight to hospital. "I hadn't been to an A&E unit for a few years and I was surprised how busy it was. There were people everywhere."It was an evening and I spent 13 hours - the whole night - sitting there on a chair before I was seen. It was awful."He eventually underwent tests and was discharged home."The staff were doing their best, but there was not enough of them. It should not be like this, he added."''Unacceptable waits'The Department of Health in Northern Ireland acknowledged the waiting times were "unacceptable" and work was under way to tackle them.But it said significant progress would require sustained additional investment and the lack of a devolved government meant it was unable to plan for the long-term.A Welsh government spokeswoman said extra money was being invested, adding: "We have placed a clear focus on those patients with an urgent need and who have waited the longest."A spokeswoman for NHS England said progress was being made, with the numbers facing really long waits falling and signs the NHS was coping better this winter than last. The latest figures released on Thursday supported this, showing A&E waits were slightly better than this time last year, while the waiting list has dropped for a second month in a row. But both are a long way from meeting the targets.Labour, which is in power in Wales, has promised it will achieve the key waiting time targets in England by the end of the next parliament if it wins the election.Image source, Getty ImagesThe three targets were all rolled out during the 2000s and have been used to track performance ever since.Each nation decides how they are measured.The four-hour A&E target is similar between each - but there are significant differences for planned hospital treatment.For example, in England it is meant to be within 18 weeks of a referral 92% of the time - and that covers everything from knee and hip operations for which patients are admitted through to outpatient appointments.In Northern Ireland, the target is 13 weeks 55% of the time - but that is just for patients who need to be admitted.Have you experienced long waits for treatment?

=====The tech industry‚Äôs layoffs and hiring freezes: all of the news - .MenuExpandFiled under:LaborUpdated Jan 12, 2024, 11:39 PM UTC The tech industry‚Äôs layoffs and hiring freezes: all of the newsBy Mitchell ClarkCommentsShare this storyOver the last couple years, it feels like we‚Äôve heard news of mass layoffs and hiring freezes from tech companies nearly every week, and since the beginning of 2024, there‚Äôs been a new wave of layoffs and firings.In the first few days of January 2024 alone:Google cut around a thousand employeesDiscord cut 17 percent of its staffTwitch cut a third of its staff (and Amazon fired hundreds from Amazon Prime Video and MGM Studios)Unity cut 25 percent of its workforceHumane cut four percent of its employeesAnd all that adds to the tens of thousands of tech and gaming layoffs that hit in 2023.Elizabeth Lopatto spoke to experts in an article published last year to try and answer the question of why so many layoffs are happening right now despite tech companies continuing to register sizable profits. One reason is that ‚Äúinvestors have changed how they‚Äôre evaluating companies,‚Äù even if there‚Äôs a lack of evidence that the layoffs can help solve any of the problems they may have.Here‚Äôs all our coverage of the recent outbreak of layoffs from big tech, auto, crypto, gaming, and more.Jan 12Emma RothInstagram‚Äôs latest job cuts reportedly affect around 60 workers.Reports from Business Insider and The Information say the impacted employees were technical program managers at Instagram. They will reportedly have until March to apply for a new role within the company.Meta made cuts across the company last year, but it seems job cuts are continuing into 2024. Google, Discord, Twitch, and Unity all announced layoffs this month, too.Instagram is cutting a level of management, allowing impacted workers to 'reinterview' for another role[Insider]Jan 11Ariel ShapiroAudible is laying off 5 percent of its staff.After laying off hundreds of employees at Twitch and Prime Video, Amazon is cutting staff at its audiobook and podcast platform, Audible. According to a memo obtained by Business Insider, Audible CEO Bob Corrigan said that the cuts were made ‚Äúto position us for continued success in the coming year and into the future‚Äù and it‚Äôs really not worth finishing the quote, because you know the drill by now. Variety reports that the cuts will include more than 100 staffers, but will not impact the content teams.Leaked email shows Amazon is slashing jobs in its Audible division, following job cuts at other teams[Insider]Jan 11Alex HeathDiscord is laying off 17 percent of employees Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeDiscord is laying off 17 percent of its staff, a move that CEO Jason Citron said is meant to ‚Äúsharpen our focus and improve the way we work together to bring more agility to our organization.‚ÄùThe cuts were announced today to employees in an all-hands meeting and internal memo I‚Äôve obtained. They‚Äôll impact 170 people across various departments.

Google just confirmed to The Verge that it‚Äôs eliminated ‚Äúa few hundred‚Äù roles in each of these divisions, meaning Google has confirmed layoffs of around a thousand employees on Wednesday alone, if we use a reasonable definition of ‚Äúfew.‚ÄùAnd those are only the cuts we know about. We asked Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini to say if this was the complete and total number of job cuts in this round of layoffs, but she stopped replying at that point, only confirming existing layoff reports at 9to5Google and Semafor. The New York Times reported on the engineering team layoffs too.

The company has confirmed it‚Äôs laying off hundreds of hardware workers, especially in its augmented reality division ‚Äî and 9to5Google is reporting that Fitbit co-founders James Park, Eric Friedman, and other Fitbit leaders are leaving the company entirely.Update, 1:42AM ET: It‚Äôs not just Fitbit and AR. Around a thousand Google layoffs were just confirmed, and there may be more. Read Article >Jan 10Ash Parrish and Jay PetersTwitch is cutting one-third of its staff Illustration by Nick Barclay / The VergeTwitch is laying off more than 500 employees, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy announced this morning, reportedly accounting for around 35 percent of its staff. Bloomberg first reported that the video game streaming platform was planning layoffs on Tuesday, and the company confirmed today that the cuts were happening.‚ÄúI regret having to share that we are taking the painful step to reduce our headcount by just over 500 people across Twitch,‚Äù Clancy wrote. ‚ÄúThis will be a very hard day.‚ÄùRead Article >Jan 10Charles Pulliam-MooreHundreds of Amazon Prime Video and MGM Studios workers are being laid off.It‚Äôs not clear exactly how many Amazon Prime Video and MGM Studios workers are being fired just ten days into the new year, but according to The Hollywood Reporter, the layoffs are coming, and the number in the hundreds.In a statement about the firings, division head Mike Hopkins described the move as being meant to increase ‚Äúour investment and focus on content and product initiatives that deliver the most impact.‚ÄùJan 10Alex HeathHumane lays off 4 percent of employees before releasing its AI PinThe Humane AI pin retails for $699 and requires a $24 per month subscription. Image: HumaneHumane laid off 4 percent of employees this week in a move that was described as a cost cutting measure to those who were impacted, according to sources familiar with the matter. Employees were recently told by leadership that budgets would be lowered this year, said one of the people, who requested anonymity to speak without the company‚Äôs permission.The cuts, which numbered 10 people, come ahead of the five-year-old startup shipping its first device: a $699, screenless, AI-powered pin that is pitched as a smartphone replacement. After a lot of hype and secrecy, Humane unveiled the AI Pin to the world in November and began accepting preorders, with shipments planned to begin in March.Read Article >Jan 9Emma RothTwitch is reportedly planning to lay off 35 percent of its staff.The Amazon-owned game streaming platform could lay off around 500 workers as soon as Wednesday, according to a report from Bloomberg. Twitch laid off dozens of workers as part of Amazon‚Äôs company-wide cuts last year, and it recently shut down its service in South Korea due to ‚Äúprohibitively expensive‚Äù costs.Amazon‚Äôs Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff[Bloomberg]Jan 8Emma RothUnity is laying off 25 percent of its staff Illustration by Cath Virginia / The VergeUnity is undergoing yet another layoff, and this time it‚Äôs going to affect about 25 percent of its entire workforce, or around 1,800 employees. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company, which makes the popular game engine Unity, said it‚Äôs making the cuts ‚Äúas it restructures and refocuses on its core business, and to position itself for long-term and profitable growth.‚ÄùUnity has been through several rounds of layoffs within the past year, with the most recent one affecting 265 workers last November. However, it‚Äôs still not clear whether Unity is cutting 1,800 additional workers on top of the layoffs it announced last year. We‚Äôve reached out to Unity for clarification.Read Article >Dec 30, 2023Ash Parrish2023‚Äôs great games were overshadowed by a dark cloud of layoffs The Verge / Photos via Getty ImagesLayoffs are an unfortunate reality of any industry, but the scope and scale of video game layoffs in 2023 are far beyond a typical year. More than any specific video game or piece of news, layoffs defined the past 12 months. Companies large and small have felt their impact. Unofficial figures estimate 9,000 workers have been affected, and at the heart of it all are corporations that valued growth at all costs ‚Äî including people.In September, Epic Games laid off 830 employees. In a statement, CEO Tim Sweeney wrote, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been spending way more money than we earn. [...] I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic.‚Äù Some of that spending was on companies like SuperAwesome and Bandcamp which Epic bought in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Both companies were sold off shortly after Epic announced layoffs.

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.TWO WEEKS before America‚Äôs Supreme Court considers whether Donald Trump may constitutionally remain on the presidential ballot, it will tackle a question closely tied to Mr Trump‚Äôs deregulatory plans for a second term. The power of some 436 federal agencies that do the bulk of the work of the federal government‚Äîfrom food safety to banking rules to pollution control‚Äîcomes under the justices‚Äô scrutiny on January 17th.Herring‚Äîa silvery fish of the North Atlantic that can be smoked, pickled or, when young, tinned‚Äîis the unlikely star of Loper Bright Enterprises v Raimondo and Relentless v Department of Commerce. Both cases involve herring fishermen upset with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), a federal agency charged with safeguarding America‚Äôs ocean resources and habitat.Drawing on a line in a statute giving the agency licence to make regulations that are ‚Äúnecessary and appropriate‚Ä¶to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks‚Äù, in 2020 the NMFS required fishermen to bring an observer along with them on their boats‚Äîand to pay that person‚Äôs per-diem fee themselves. Space on these vessels is a ‚Äúscarce and precious resource‚Äù, the fisheries‚Äô lawyer argues, making the NMFS‚Äôs rule (which was suspended in April 2023) an ‚Äúenormous imposition‚Äù. Making the fishermen foot the bill ‚Äúadds insult to injury‚Äù.The rule nevertheless found receptive audiences at two of America‚Äôs appellate courts. In allowing the agency to impose the regulation, three-judge panels on both courts turned to a Supreme Court decision, Chevron USA v Natural Resources Defence Council, that has managed the inter-branch balance of power since 1984.Chevron has two steps. First, judges determine if a law governing an administrative agency speaks clearly. If it does, judges interpret it themselves and tell the agencies what the law means. But if judges believe the law is ambiguous, they give bureaucrats the benefit of the doubt. At this second step, if the court sees the agency‚Äôs interpretation as reasonable‚Äîeven if it is not the interpretation the court thinks best‚Äîit defers to the agency. In Loper Bright and Relentless, the circuit courts concluded that the law in question is ambiguous and that the NMFS‚Äôs interpretation of it is reasonable.Chevron was popular among conservative justices in its early days. Five years after it was decided, Antonin Scalia (an arch-conservative justice who died in 2016) gave a lecture at Duke Law School in which he predicted that agency deference would endure as it ‚Äúreflects the reality of government‚Äù and ‚Äúserves its needs‚Äù. Yet two justices on the court today‚ÄîNeil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas‚Äîhave made clear their deep disdain for what has become known as ‚ÄúChevron deference‚Äù.In a 2015 case involving the Environmental Protection Agency, Justice Thomas wrote that the wide berth Chevron afforded bureaucrats meant the court was ‚Äúblithely giving the force of law‚Äù to ‚Äúagency ‚Äòinterpretations‚Äô of federal statutes‚Äù (note the scare quotes) and thereby straying ‚Äúfurther and further from the constitution‚Äù. For Justice Gorsuch, who was railing against Chevron when he was still a judge on the 10th circuit court of appeals, agency deference is akin to ‚Äújudicial abdication‚Äù.The plaintiffs in Loper Bright and Relentless are banking on at least three more justices keen on reining in the administrative state. It may be a good bet. Brett Kavanaugh, two years before he became a justice, raised critical questions about Chevron in an article in the Harvard Law Review. The conservative majority has not invoked Chevron since 2016. The plaintiffs write that the doctrine has been ‚Äúthe-case-which-must-not-be-named‚Äù at the high court for years; the conservative court may see this as the moment to give Chevron, as Justice Gorsuch put it in 2022, ‚Äúa tombstone no one can miss‚Äù.Dozens of friend-of-the-court briefs urge the justices to do just that: bury-Chevron filings outnumber save-Chevron briefs by a ratio of four to one. But the implications of ditching the 40-year-old precedent are contested. For the plaintiffs, ‚ÄúChevron‚Äôs primary victim is the citizenry‚Äù because the approach ‚Äúliterally gives the tie to their regulators in every close case‚Äù.Not all regulations, though, are as hard to swallow as forcing fishermen to dole out up to a fifth of their profits to an on-board observer. Federal agencies, staffed by some 2.2m civil servants with expertise that judges often lack, protect workplace safety and respond to natural disasters. They keep aeroplanes and financial markets aloft. The government warns that abandoning Chevron‚Äîwhich lower courts continue to rely on even as the Supreme Court has quietly ignored it‚Äîwould ‚Äúthreaten settled expectations in virtually every area of conduct regulated by federal law‚Äù. ‚ñ†Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.Explore moreUnited StatesThis article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "Fed herring"United States January 13th 2024Donald Trump‚Äôs Iowa operation suggests his campaign will be formidableThe US Supreme Court is primed to recalibrate government powerJoe Biden‚Äôs disappearing defence secretaryA lawsuit in New York may shake things up at the NRABroadway is struggling to find its rhythm after the pandemicRon DeSantis has some lessons for America‚Äôs politiciansFrom the January 13th 2024 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Explore the editionShareReuse this contentMore from United StatesA lawsuit in New York may shake things up at the NRAWayne LaPierre‚Äôs resignation is just the startBroadway is struggling to find its rhythm after the pandemicThe Great White Way is looking slightly less greatRon DeSantis has some lessons for America‚Äôs politiciansHe is showing how hard it is to run for president in general, and against Donald Trump in particularSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentHelp and contact usKeep updatedLinkedInFacebookXInstagramThreadsTikTokYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in ‚Äúa severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.‚Äù The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist Impact EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesExecutive JobsTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Data RightsCopyright ¬© The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Most online commentators in China support Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. At the same time they criticise Russia‚Äôs failure to achieve a swift victory. They accuse the West of prolonging the conflict by supporting Ukraine‚Äôs army, but also fault Russia for its military weakness. Corruption has crippled its fighting ability, they often conclude, despite all its spending in recent years on better kit. It is taboo in China to cast aspersions on the war-readiness of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA). But amid reports that it is also struggling with graft as it splurges on new weaponry, there may be good reason for it, too, to worry.China gives little detail of corruption in its armed forces, beyond‚Äîoccasionally‚Äîhighlighting a few egregious cases. It has offered no explanation for a purge of generals that began months ago and is widely believed to involve dishonest dealings. On January 10th a three-day annual meeting in Beijing of anti-corruption chiefs ended as usual with no public mention of military matters, such as the ousting last year of the defence minister, General Li Shangfu. He has not been seen in public since August (it was not until December that his successor, Admiral Dong Jun, was named). Yet this appears to be the biggest graft-related shake-up in the PLA in years.In the past, the country‚Äôs leader, Xi Jinping, has openly fretted about the impact of corruption on the PLA‚Äôs combat skills. ‚ÄúWhen I see materials reflecting these issues, I feel deep disgust and often can‚Äôt help but slam the table,‚Äù he said in 2014 during his first big campaign against officers on the take. ‚ÄúThese problems have reached a point where they must be resolved urgently,‚Äù he went on. ‚ÄúIf the army is corrupt, it can‚Äôt fight.‚Äù In 2018 the Communist Party declared a ‚Äúcrushing victory‚Äù in its war against graft in all domains. But it was far from total: the campaign remains ‚Äúgrim and complex‚Äù, Mr Xi said at the just-concluded gathering in the capital. That has been a common official refrain since the purported triumph was achieved.Within the PLA the war has reignited. According to Bloomberg, an American news service, the purge has toppled more than a dozen senior military officials in the past six months. They mainly belonged to the PLA Rocket Force, which is responsible for the country‚Äôs arsenal of land-based conventional and strategic missiles, and the Equipment Development Department, which procures and tests weaponry. Quoting unspecified people familiar with assessments by American spooks, Bloomberg says corruption in the Rocket Force and defence industries ‚Äúis so extensive that US officials now believe Xi is less likely to contemplate major military action in the coming years than would otherwise have been the case‚Äù.If so, that may be good news for Taiwan, which will hold presidential and legislative elections on January 13th. Tensions may rise should the presidential front-runner, Lai Ching-te, win. He is viewed by China, which claims the island, as a staunch believer in Taiwan‚Äôs perpetual separation from the mainland. But come what may, American officials believe that Mr Xi has ordered the Chinese armed forces to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027, the centenary of the PLA‚Äôs founding.He is not expected to relax in that effort. State media suggest that a milestone will be reached this year with sea trials of China‚Äôs third aircraft-carrier, the Fujian‚Äîthe country‚Äôs largest such vessel as well as the first one entirely of Chinese design. But if Mr Xi believes that corruption is truly rife in the PLA, he may think twice about sending it on such a hugely ambitious mission, especially given the difficulties faced by Russia‚Äôs army. It had a lot more fighting experience than China‚Äôs when it invaded Ukraine. China has not fought a war since a brief one with Vietnam in 1979.Ready, aim, firedIn a war with Taiwan, the Rocket Force would play a big role, both in mounting missile attacks against the island and in trying to keep America at bay. The recent purge began in July with the replacement of its commander, General Li Yuchao, his number two, General Liu Guangbin, and the force‚Äôs political commissar, General Xu Zhongbo. A former deputy commander of the force, General Zhang Zhenzhong, was also dismissed. In December nine senior officers were expelled from the country‚Äôs rubber-stamp legislature, the National People‚Äôs Congress. They included Generals Li and Zhang as well as three others linked to the Rocket Force.The reasons are obscure. It is widely speculated that possible wrongdoing has included the leaking of secrets about the force as well as corruption. Bloomberg, citing the American intelligence, says graft in the Rocket Force has led to missiles being filled with water instead of fuel and the malfunctioning of lids covering missile silos in western China.When Mr Xi took power in 2012, the armed forces were rife with corruption. Senior military posts were being sold for hefty sums. They were worth it: holders could rake in money, such as by taking bribes from military contractors or doing deals with private businesses involving PLA land. Mr Xi was ferocious in his attacks on the PLA‚Äôs corrupt ‚Äútigers‚Äù. Dozens of generals were purged, among them two retired ones who had served as the most senior uniformed officials in the army, Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou. Mr Guo is now serving a life sentence. Xu died of cancer before a trial could get under way. It is striking that, after so much effort by Mr Xi to clean up the PLA, high-level graft persists.Mr Xi‚Äôs shake-up of the armed forces has included raising the status of its anti-corruption agency. In 2016 the PLA‚Äôs graft-busters began copying the way their civilian counterparts operate by sending teams into military units to look for corruption. Mr Xi has also stepped up political education among the troops, hoping that earnest study of Xi Jinping Thought on Strengthening the Military, as his teachings are officially known, would help improve their behaviour. Stay absolutely loyal to Mr Xi and the party is the essence of soldiers‚Äô frequent study sessions. (Whether these time-consuming classes get in the way of training men to fight is something Mr Xi appears not to question.)There is little sign that recent ill-discipline involves any direct challenge to his leadership. With his round-up of generals a decade ago, Mr Xi seems to have stifled potential opposition to his rule from within the armed forces. Many of those officers appeared to have been singled out because of their loyalty to his predecessors, whom he viewed as rivals.But Mr Xi is still troubled by what he sees as potential threats to his rule. In his speech at the anti-graft meeting, he said that ‚Äúbreaking free from the historical cycle‚Äù should be viewed as a ‚Äústrategic goal‚Äù. This was a reference to one of his preoccupations: the fall of great empires as a result of rot. ‚ÄúThroughout history, many armies with remarkable military achievements ultimately fell victim to corruption and were brought down. This must serve as a warning,‚Äù said a screed on Mr Xi‚Äôs military thinking that was published last year on the defence ministry‚Äôs website. It is clear that some officers are not studying their textbooks hard enough. ‚ñ†Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China‚Äîand what China makes of the world.Explore moreChinaThis article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline "Getting soft"China January 13th 2024Xi Jinping is struggling to stamp out graft in the PLAChina heaps pressure on Taiwan ahead of a big electionA comical effort by China‚Äôs intelligence agencyNostalgia for China‚Äôs boom years drives a TV hitFrom the January 13th 2024 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Explore the editionShareReuse this contentMore from ChinaA comical effort by China‚Äôs intelligence agencyWill a new cartoon convince people to look out for spies?Nostalgia for China‚Äôs boom years drives a TV hitA drama series presents 1990s capitalists as heroes, not villainsChina heaps pressure on Taiwan ahead of a big electionChoose our favoured candidate or suffer the consequences, hints the mainlandSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentHelp and contact usKeep updatedLinkedInFacebookXInstagramThreadsTikTokYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in ‚Äúa severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.‚Äù The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist Impact EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesExecutive JobsTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Data RightsCopyright ¬© The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Politicians share with estate agents a tendency to stretch the truth and skate over unpleasant details. The resemblance extends to home ownership itself, where one of the animating ideas of housing policy is more fiction than truth. Ask a politician from any major party about property and the words ‚Äúhousing ladder‚Äù will soon crop up. Both Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, and Sir Keir Starmer, Labour‚Äôs leader, are keen to tell voters how they will help young people get onto its first rung.The ladder is deeply embedded into British thinking. On its most narrow definition, it is usually taken to mean the idea of first-time buyers purchasing a modest dwelling (a flat, say) and then trading up to something larger as their incomes grow and their housing equity increases. More broadly, the metaphor reflects Britons‚Äô general aspiration to residential-property ownership. The private rented sector, by this way of thinking, is a waiting room that people spend some time in before progressing to owning their own home. Getting onto the ladder‚Äîand avoiding property snakes associated with unemployment or divorce‚Äîis a natural stage in life.image: The EconomistThe problem for Britain‚Äôs policymakers is that the facts do not fit this fable. Home ownership peaked almost 20 years ago. Between 1961 and 2001 the proportion of owner-occupied English housing rose from just over 40% to just under 70%. Since then it has fallen (see chart 1).The ratio of house prices to earnings in Britain, according to the Office for National Statistics, is now over eight, compared with a norm of closer to four for most of the 1950s to 1990s. Just getting onto the first rung of the ladder is much harder as a result. Only around a third of younger Britons now own their home at the age of 30, compared with more than half of earlier generations at that same age (see chart 2).image: The EconomistEven those who do make it onto the ladder are less likely to trade up than in the past. A 2017 report for the Council of Mortgage Lenders, a trade body, found that movement by existing home owners had been declining for three decades as affordability and borrowing constraints limited the ability to ‚Äútrade up‚Äù.The housing ladder, in other words, is an idea that is around two decades out of date. It existed as a result of a particular set of economic and policy circumstances which lasted from the 1950s until the early 2000s. And whatever Britain‚Äôs politicians might desire, those circumstances are unlikely to return.The first factor that made the ladder possible was generally falling interest rates and wider access to mortgage finance. Mortgage availability was liberalised in the 1970s and 1980s; banks were happy to lend ever larger multiples of salaries and at ever higher loan-to-value ratios. At the aggregate level, the ratio of household debt to income‚Äîthe bulk of which is mortgage lending‚Äîrose from under 60% in the late 1960s to a peak of over 180% in 2007. This was the era of now-failed mortgage lenders such as Northern Rock happily offering 130% loan-to-value mortgages to new buyers. Those days are long gone, primarily as a result of tighter financial regulation.A second factor was the sale of council-owned housing to existing tenants at discounted prices, which began in earnest in the 1980s under the Right to Buy scheme. Around a tenth of Britain‚Äôs housing stock was transferred from state ownership to private hands over the course of little more than a decade. That, though, was a one-time trick. Policymakers from both main parties now say they are keen to put up more houses. Talk of reforming the planning system to increase English house-building to 300,000 new units a year is welcome. But the most optimistic analysts believe that even a decade of building at such levels would reduce house prices by only around 10%; the house-price-to-earnings ratio would still be around seven.An ageing population also plays a role in the supply of housing. Older Britons, those more likely to have benefited from the housing boom of previous decades, are living for longer than they did a few decades ago. And a home owner in their 30s is twice as likely to move as a home owner in their 50s. Houses do not cycle back onto the market as quickly as they once did.Britain‚Äôs politicians may struggle to recognise it, therefore, but the nature of the British housing market has changed fundamentally. The private rental market is no longer a waiting room; for many people it is the destination. In 2001 fewer than one in ten Britons rented privately; now one in five do. That has important implications for housing policy. Rather than fretting about owner-occupation, for example, a modern housing agenda would be much more concerned about professionalising the rented sector. The British market is unusually fragmented; the typical landlord owns two or three properties, and the single largest institution has a market share of just 0.2%. Encouraging larger entities into the rental sector would make sense, among other things.The removal of the ladder has wider implications, too. Take monetary policy. In the early 1990s almost 45% of British households had a mortgage compared with 30% today. The mortgage market has conventionally been a major part of the transmission mechanism through which changes in the Bank of England‚Äôs base rate have fed into consumer behaviour. In a world with a structurally smaller mortgage market more pain has to be concentrated on a smaller number of households to get the same effect.image: The EconomistThe changing shape of the housing market also poses an underappreciated long-term fiscal risk for the government. Britain‚Äôs welfare system is built on the implicit assumption that pensioners will either have paid off their mortgages and own their homes by the time they retire or will be living in subsidised social housing. In 2021 there were almost 1.2m private-sector tenants in England aged between 45 and 64, a rise of 70% on a decade before. As they begin to retire over the coming decade their incomes will fall but their housing costs will not. The result will be a large rise in pensioner poverty, a large rise in the housing-benefit bill as the government subsidises their housing costs, or, most probably, some combination of the two.The housing ladder may have died two decades ago but its allure as a metaphor remains. That continues to blind Britain‚Äôs politicians and voters to the reality of the property market. Rather than harking back to a bygone age, Britain‚Äôs politicians need to accept that there is more to housing than home ownership. ‚ñ†For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.Explore moreBritainThis article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "The housing ladder, 1950-2005"Britain January 13th 2024The housing ladder, 1950-2005A typically British way to smooth handovers of powerBritain‚Äôs worst miscarriage of justice sparks outrage at lastBritain‚Äôs health-care system looks rather as it did in the 1930sWales wants to be more like ScandinaviaCounting Britain‚Äôs beauties and leech-bleedersKeir Starmer, Reform UK and Britain‚Äôs populist paradoxFrom the January 13th 2024 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Explore the editionShareReuse this contentMore from BritainWales wants to be more like ScandinaviaEasier said than doneKeir Starmer, Reform UK and Britain‚Äôs populist paradoxA country ripe for the radical right is on course to elect a centrist who wants a quieter politicsCounting Britain‚Äôs beauties and leech-bleedersA tour of the country‚Äôs statistical past and a debate over its futureSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentHelp and contact usKeep updatedLinkedInFacebookXInstagramThreadsTikTokYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in ‚Äúa severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.‚Äù The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist Impact EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesExecutive JobsTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Data RightsCopyright ¬© The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.IT TAKES THE ET5, an electric saloon from NIO, a Chinese carmaker founded in 2014, a mere four seconds to accelerate from a standstill to 100kph. That is more or less the same as the Porsche Carrera, a German petrol-powered sportscar beloved by adrenalin junkies. Chinese electric vehicles (evs) are setting new standards for speed‚Äîin terms both of how fast they go and of how fast they are spreading around the globe. Already China‚Äôs streets are clogged with them. And if Chinese manufacturers have their way, America‚Äôs and Europe‚Äôs soon will be, too. An industry used to a sedate cycle of marginal improvements is being upended at ‚ÄúChina speed‚Äù, says Ralf Brandst√§tter, Volkswagen‚Äôs boss in the country.In 2023, Chinese industry groups claim, China overtook Japan to become the world‚Äôs biggest exporter of cars, in part because of surging sales of EVs. In the final quarter of 2023, BYD, a Chinese firm, surpassed Tesla as the world‚Äôs biggest manufacturer of purely battery-powered vehicles, selling 526,000 of them to the American firm‚Äôs 484,000. As the shift away from the internal-combustion engine (ice) gathers pace, established carmakers are beginning to worry that Chinese upstarts might run them off the road.The anxiety is well-founded. Western firms‚Äô expertise making ices counts for little in the electrical age. What is more, the Chinese government has hugely subsidised the ev industry. China dominates the manufacture of electric cars‚Äô most critical component, batteries. And China‚Äôs vast domestic market allows local firms to benefit from economies of scale.Chinese firms face some obstacles, too. For starters, many of the country‚Äôs new EV startups are not yet profitable, despite the generous handouts. As their exports increase, the Chinese government may balk at subsidising Western consumers as lavishly as it has Chinese ones. Countervailing subsidies and other protectionist measures are on the rise around the world. And fears that Chinese-made cars might somehow compromise the security of importing countries may also become an impediment to exports. All that notwithstanding, however, it seems all but certain that Chinese EVs will become a big presence on the world‚Äôs roads, just as Japanese and South Korean cars did before them.BYD shows what China can do. A tech firm that once specialised in batteries, it began making cars in 2003‚Äîat first with limited success. Although it managed to become the world‚Äôs biggest manufacturer of electric buses, as recently as 2017 it sold only 420,000, mostly ICE, cars. Sales were falling. Last year, however, it sold 3m pure electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles‚Äîat a profit. It exports to over 70 countries and on December 22nd announced that it would build an ev factory in Hungary, to serve the European market from within.RoadkillFirms like byd are frightening to foreign carmakers because China has the world‚Äôs most developed market for EVs, and local brands dominate it. That is not because foreign carmakers have no presence in the country‚Äîfar from it. Until recently, firms like Volkswagen and BMW were thriving in China. Since the 1990s they have made and sold lots of cars there through joint ventures with local firms. As these joint ventures grew, China became the world‚Äôs biggest producer of cars in 2009. It also became the world‚Äôs biggest market and the biggest source of profits for many Western brands. Volkswagen Group, for instance, sold 3.2m cars in China in 2023, around a third of its global sales.image: The EconomistIn 2017 the government allowed Tesla to make cars in China without a local partner. It opened a factory in Shanghai in 2019. This was part of a concerted effort to promote the adoption of EVs, which have quickly become the fastest-growing element of China‚Äôs car industry (see chart 1). In November some 42% of car sales in China were either pure battery or hybrids. That is well ahead of both the EU, at 25% or so, and America, at just 10%. What is more, although the pace is slowing, Chinese EV sales are still growing fast: by 28% in the third quarter of 2023 compared with a year earlier, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Most forecasters reckon that by 2030 some 80-90% of cars sold in China will be EVs. And China is now by far the biggest car market in the world, with about 22m passenger vehicles sold in 2022, compared with less than 13m in both America and Europe.That is why it alarms foreign carmakers that Chinese brands are pre-eminent in local EV sales. The Chinese market as a whole remains roughly evenly split between foreign and domestic brands (see chart 2). But for EVs, the ratio is more like 80:20, according to UBS, a Swiss bank. As a result, Volkswagen‚Äôs market share in China has slumped, from nearly 20% in 2020 to 14% in 2023. Its share of EV sales is a puny 3%.image: The EconomistChinese firms‚Äô advantage stems partly from subsidies for local firms. Government handouts for electric and hybrid vehicles added up to $57bn in 2016-22, says AlixPartners, a consultancy. Rhodium Group, a research firm, estimates that between 2015 and 2020 BYD alone received $4.3bn via cheap loans and equity.Perhaps just as important was $2.5bn in similar support for CATL, which in 2017 became the world‚Äôs biggest manufacturer of the lithium-ion batteries used in most EVs. All told, China now makes 70% of the world‚Äôs lithium-ion batteries. Purchase subsidies, which will be worth more than $4,000 a car this year, have also helped the EV industry. Protectionism has played a part, too: only cars with domestically made batteries are eligible for the purchase subsidies, a rule which in effect shut out Japanese and South Korean competition.All this has helped build a vast local supply chain, which now benefits from economies of scale. VW reckons it cuts manufacturing costs by at least 30% by sourcing locally. Chinese-made ‚Äúinfotainment‚Äù systems for its cars, for example, are 34% cheaper than older versions bought abroad, even though they have 70% more computing power, says Ludger L√ºhrmann, chief technology officer at VW‚Äôs new innovation centre in the city of Hefei.Low costs mean low prices, which are also kept in check through furious competition. There are around 150 carmakers in China, including foreign brands, big state-owned companies and EV startups, all vying with one another for market share. Tesla recently initiated a price war, in an effort to sustain sales.But Chinese EVs are not just cheap, they also enjoy superior technology in some respects. Analysts believe that one of the main ways that brands of EVs will differentiate themselves is by their software and styling. Here China has an edge, because its drivers are so much younger than Western buyers. They value sophisticated infotainment systems with first-rate sound and images. Research from Langston, a consultancy, suggests that they rank BYD and NIO higher on these measures than Western carmakers, even though they do not consider Chinese EVs safer, more reliable or more comfortable. As Pedro Pacheco of Gartner, another consultancy, points out, Chinese firms are also managed differently. They are less risk averse and move faster than foreign firms, quickly updating tech and introducing new models to keep customers interested. Treating new cars like consumer-tech products, such as smartphones, extends to ditching duds quickly. Li Auto now ceases production of new models in a matter of months if they do not sell well.EV startups such as Li Auto, NIO and Xpeng were all founded by tech billionaires who, like Tesla‚Äôs Elon Musk, regard their firms as tech companies that happen to make cars. In fact, lots of Chinese tech firms are getting involved in the car industry. Whereas Apple has mulled such a venture long and indecisively, Xiaomi, a big Chinese smartphone-maker, unveiled its first vehicle in December (a fancy and expensive saloon). It plans to make cheaper models in future with the immodest goal of becoming one of the world‚Äôs top five carmakers in 15-20 years. Huawei, a telecoms firm, and Baidu, a search engine, have also teamed up with car firms to make vehicles.Foreign carmakers, in contrast, are struggling to transform into Tesla-like software firms. They are used to the slower cycles of the ICE age. But firms that launch a new model every six or seven years cannot keep pace with buccaneering Chinese rivals, which move almost twice as fast. Foreign firms‚Äô habit of ‚Äúlocalising‚Äù global models with small adaptations for specific markets also results in cars that are far behind Chinese customers‚Äô expectations.Old bangersAs a result, foreign brands are losing an allure that allowed them to charge double or triple what a Chinese firm might ask for an ICE car. Naturally, they are trying to adapt. Most have long had R&D outposts in China as well as other important locations such as Silicon Valley. VW‚Äôs facility in Hefei is one of its main global innovation centres, in part to keep up with the tech demands of Chinese buyers.Foreign firms are also forming new alliances with Chinese ones. VW agreed in July to acquire a 5% stake in Xpeng for $700m. Together they plan to develop two new electric SUVs by 2026, which may help VW regain some of the ground it has lost. It has also struck deals with Horizon Robotics, a Chinese software firm, and Gotion, a Chinese battery-maker. Stellantis (whose largest shareholder owns a stake in The Economist) has had little presence in China since a joint venture to make Jeeps folded in 2022. But in October it signed a deal with Leapmotor to make and sell low-cost EVs outside China.Such is the drubbing foreign firms are receiving at the cheaper end of the market that they may all depart in the next five years, reckons Michael Dunne of Dunne Insights, a consultancy. The fancier German brands, BMW and Mercedes, and Lexus, Toyota‚Äôs upmarket arm, may hang on for longer. Dedicated new EV platforms, to replace ones shared with ICE models, will be introduced in the next few years, bringing better tech and lower costs. But some analysts see the market as a lost cause: Patrick Hummel of UBS suggests that, instead of throwing money at China to regain market share, firms should just cash in while they still can.This grim outlook is especially troubling because, although China‚Äôs adoption of EVs has been rapid, the rest of the world is clearly headed in the same direction. The EU has banned sales of ICE cars from 2035. America is encouraging drivers to switch by offering lavish subsidies of its own. By 2035 EVs should account for perhaps 70% of global sales. That would amount to 60m-70m vehicles a year. Chinese firms are already looking to new markets.image: The EconomistEurope is likely to become the next battleground. Chinese firms‚Äô models, which are mostly small hatchbacks and SUVs, suit the continent‚Äôs motorists. Tariffs of 10% are relatively low and the Chinese already have a foothold. Geely, a big Chinese carmaker, owns several European brands, including Volvo, Lotus and Polestar (an EV-only spin-off from Volvo). It hopes its European expertise will help it sell Chinese-made evs from its Lynk&Co and Zeekr brands. MG, which belongs to SAIC, a state-owned carmaker, is Europe‚Äôs best-selling pure-electric brand from China. Cars made by BYD, Great Wall Motors, NIO and Xpeng are on sale in a number of European countries. Other firms, such as HiPhi, are on the way.So far the influx is small. Around 40% of Chinese exports in 2023, some 2.2m cars, will have been evs reckons Canalys, a consultancy. Nonetheless, 9% of the purely battery-powered EVs sold in Europe in the first ten months of 2023 were made by Chinese firms, according to Schmidt Automotive, a data firm. Mass-market European firms such as Renault, Stellantis and VW are struggling to make smaller, cheaper EVs that can compete both with ICE equivalents and Chinese imports. VW‚Äôs ID.3 and Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 are both about 15% more expensive in Europe than BYD‚Äôs Seal, a midsized saloon that is bigger and arguably better. In China the Seal costs less than half what it does in Europe but is still profitable. Even taking into account shipping costs and tariffs, BYD could cut prices in Europe and still make money. Thanks to such arithmetic, UBS thinks Chinese carmakers‚Äô market share in Europe could rise from 3% in 2022 to 20% in 2030.Chinese carmakers will face obstacles on their advance into Europe. Most of their brands are unknown to European consumers. Winning customers away from firms with a loyal following, such as BMW and Mercedes, will be especially tricky. Establishing a retail network, either through direct sales or dealers, takes time and money. So does setting up after-sale servicing.These expensive tasks will be especially onerous for the many Chinese ev startups that are losing money. Fast introduction of new models has its downside. Costs have to be amortised over a much shorter period than is typical in the industry, says Mr Hummel. Bernstein, a broker, reckons that Li Auto might report a profit for 2023 but that NIO and Xpeng will lose money for the next few years. NIO has already had a state bail-out, is said to lose $35,000 per sale and in November said it would lay off 10% of its employees. (Although in December it secured $2.2bn from an investment fund from the United Arab Emirates.)The consolidation of the industry that China‚Äôs government has long desired looks inevitable. In the long run, however, that should create a clutch of stronger firms, better able to compete internationally. Mr Hummel thinks China will eventually end up with 10-12 firms making over 1m cars, some of which will go global.SpeedtrapsChinese exporters may find that European governments put roadblocks in their way. In December France introduced a new subsidy scheme that favours cars made in Europe and Italy is considering doing the same. The European Commission initiated an investigation of state subsidies for Chinese car firms in October, which could lead to an increase in tariffs.Coming soon to a street near youimage: Getty ImagesYet these protectionist measures are unlikely to halt Chinese firms‚Äô advance. Higher tariffs are not ‚Äúlive or die‚Äù, according to Lihong Qin, a co-founder of NIO. Europe‚Äôs carmakers are not baying for them. China remains a big market for most of them, and they worry about retaliatory measures. Moreover, cars exported from European firms‚Äô factories in China would also be hit by higher tariffs. Even Stellantis, whose boss, Carlos Tavares, warns of a ‚Äúterrible fight‚Äù with the Chinese and once loudly called for protection, is critical of the probe. It may be worried about the implications for its tie-up with Leapmotor.Higher tariffs may also prompt more Chinese firms to start making cars in Europe. BYD is said to be planning at least one more factory in Europe in addition to the one in Hungary. Japanese and South Korean car firms started to thrive abroad only after they localised production. This strategy, argues Bernstein, not only makes it easier to cater to local tastes, but also ‚Äúbrings local governments and local defenders on-board‚Äù.Even America‚Äôs efforts to slam the door on China‚Äôs car firms may not succeed. It levies tariffs of 27.5% on imported EVs and restricts purchase subsidies to vehicles that are made in America. But Chinese carmakers are making inroads in Mexico, a country with a free-trade agreement with America. Their market share has roared ahead, from 0.5% in 2016 to 20% today. NAFTA‚Äôs rules-of-origin requirements prevent vehicles made in China from being re-exported to the United States duty-free. But there is nothing to stop Chinese firms from building factories in Mexico. Several of them, including BYD, Geely and SAIC are nosing around for locations. As long as the putative factories used enough locally made parts, their output would escape America‚Äôs prohibitive tariffs.Again, building factories and setting up supply chains takes time. It took Japanese and South Korean carmakers decades to establish themselves in America and Europe and win the trust of local consumers. Chinese firms appear to be making faster progress. But whether they arrive at ‚ÄúChina speed‚Äù or simply very quickly, Chinese cars are on their way. The monitors that are often fitted to new cars to detect if a driver is nodding off should be pinging urgently in Western carmakers‚Äô boardrooms. ‚ñ†Explore moreChinaThis article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline "The car east"From the January 13th 2024 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Explore the editionShareReuse this contentMore from BriefingJoe Biden‚Äôs chances do not look good.

=====Annie Nightingale: Trailblazing BBC Radio 1 DJ dies at 83 - BBC NewsCultureAnnie Nightingale: Trailblazing BBC Radio 1 DJ dies at 83Published9 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, BBC/David VenniImage caption, Nightingale's family described her as "a pioneer, trailblazer and an inspiration to many"By Ian Youngs & Noor NanjiBBC NewsBBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Nightingale, the station's first female presenter, who went on to become its longest-serving host, has died at the age of 83.Nightingale joined the station in 1970 and remained the only woman on the line-up for 12 years.She was known for her passion for a wide range of music, championing everything from prog rock and punk to acid house and grime.She remained on air until late last year with Annie Nightingale Presents.Nightingale was also known for co-hosting BBC Two music show The Old Grey Whistle Test.Obituary: Innovative DJ who always had the hottest tunesTributes have been flooding in, with DJ Annie Mac saying Nightingale was "a trailblazer, spirited, adventurous, fearless, hilarious, smart, and so good at her job".Writing on Instagram, she added: "This is the woman who changed the face and sound of British TV and radio broadcasting forever. You can't underestimate it."BBC Radio 2 presenter Zoe Ball said she was "heartbroken" at the news, adding: "She loved music like no other, she sought out the tunes and artists that shaped our lives, she interviewed them all, opening doors for musicians, DJs and broadcasters alike."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Annie Nightingale: "I became the token woman"Fellow Radio 2 host Jo Whiley said Nightingale was "the coolest woman who ever graced the airwaves".She added: "She blazed a trail for us all and never compromised. Her passion for music never diminished."6 Music DJ and Desert Island Discs host Lauren Laverne thanked Nightingale "for opening the door and for showing us all what to do when we got through it", adding: "You will be missed so much."The news of Nightingale's death was announced on BBC Radio 1, with presenter Mollie King saying she had "really championed female talent"."I think I can say I speak for myself and other women in broadcasting when I say we owe her an immense amount of gratitude for everything she has done."This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, BBC Radio 1 pays tribute to legendary DJ Annie NightingaleTim Davie, director general of the BBC, called Nightingale a "uniquely gifted broadcaster".He continued: "As well as being a trailblazer for new music, she was a champion for female broadcasters, supporting and encouraging other women to enter the industry. We will all miss her terribly."Six brilliant stories from Annie Nightingale's 50 years of broadcastingListen to Annie Nightingale on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island DiscsWomen in popular music: Annie NightingaleA statement attributed to her family on Friday said she "passed away yesterday at her home in London after a short illness"."Annie was a pioneer, trailblazer and an inspiration to many. Her impulse to share that enthusiasm with audiences remained undimmed after six decades of broadcasting on BBC TV and radio globally."Never underestimate the role model she became. Breaking down doors by refusing to bow down to sexual prejudice and male fear gave encouragement to generations of young women who, like Annie, only wanted to tell you about an amazing tune they had just heard."Watching Annie do this on television in the 1970s, most famously as a presenter on the BBC music show The Old Grey Whistle Test, or hearing her play the latest breakbeat techno on Radio One is testimony to someone who never stopped believing in the magic of rock 'n' roll."They added that a celebration of her life would take place at a memorial service in the spring.'A pioneer for women'Nightingale famously presented Radio 1's Request Show in the 1970s, 80s and 90s before moving to an overnight slot. She also hosted occasional shows on Radio 2, 5 Live and 6 Music, as well as a range of documentaries."Every week, in my job, is a new adventure. I enjoy it," she said last July. "People don't understand. Most people get bored with pop music when they're a certain age. I go on being interested in where it's going, the twists and turns."Radio 1's current boss Aled Haydn Jones said in a statement: "All of us at Radio 1 are devastated to lose Annie, our thoughts are with her family and friends."He added: "She was the first female DJ on Radio 1 and over her 50 years on the station was a pioneer for women in the industry and in dance music. We have lost a broadcasting legend."Final showRadio 1 presenter Greg James wrote on X that Nightingale's life and achievements had been "so extraordinary you couldn't possibly sum them up on here".Glastonbury Festival co-organiser Emily Eavis said she had been "an inspiration to so many women in music" and a "lovely human being".She added: "Goodbye dear Annie, a female trailblazer and true enthusiast."Nightingale was last on air with a three-part "best of 2023" show on 19 December.After playing tracks by Dimitri Vegas, Daft Punk, Sam Smith and Bad Bunny she signed off by wishing listeners "a brilliant Christmas".Her final words on Radio 1 were, appropriately, "lots of love, from me to you".Related TopicsBBCRadioMusicMore on this storyBBC Radio 1 pays tribute to legendary DJ Annie Nightingale.

That was just the first of many research programs NASA aimed to fund in order to take bold steps forward in aviation, either in speed, efficiency or size.Until now the aircraft has only been seen in various stages of disassembly in the hangar; today marks the first time it's been out on the tarmac in public view, and of course they made quite a to-do over at Lockheed's Palmdale facility."In just a few short years we‚Äôve gone from an ambitious concept to reality. NASA‚Äôs X-59 will help change the way we travel, bringing us closer together in much less time," said Pam Melroy, NASA deputy administrator, in a press release. (A press call is scheduled for later today, and this article may soon be updated to reflect remarks made therein.)The X-59 is an experimental aircraft, not a prototype of a production craft. The intent is to demonstrate that a plane can fly faster than the speed of sound ‚Äî in this case, 925 MPH ‚Äî without generating the window-rattling sonic boom that results from the resulting pressure wave.Though it's impossible to entirely mitigate the effect of a large body moving through the atmosphere at great speed, the team aims to reduce the boom to a "sonic thump" that's less disruptive to people, infrastructure and wildlife.Schlieren image of a model X-59 producing a diffuse pressure wave at Mach speed. Image Credits: NASA"By demonstrating the possibility of quiet commercial supersonic travel over land, we seek to open new commercial markets for U.S. companies and benefit travelers around the world," said NASA's Bob Pearce.It accomplishes this more or less by its incredibly aerodynamic shape: Nearly 100 feet long and only 29.5 feet wide, it has a dartlike profile that is carefully engineered to break up the shock waves coming off it in flight.An interesting consequence of this shape is that having a forward-facing window in the cockpit is impractical ‚Äî it, like the nosecone, would need to be highly attenuated. So the team instead mounted a 4K screen they call the eXternal Visibility System, or XVS, which relays images from the front in real time.NASA‚Äôs X-59 supersonic jet will have a 4K TV instead of a forward windowThe plane has not yet taken off, for there are many more tests before that can happen. But now that they've got weight on wheels, they can move on to "integrated systems testing, engine runs, and taxi testing" ahead of its first flight, tentatively scheduled for "later this year." A subsonic flight is planned, then more tests, then the crucial first supersonic flight.Others than NASA and Lockheed are interested in this kind of flight, of course: Boom Supersonic is hard at work getting its own quiet supersonic test plane out there. Just don't expect to hear any sonic thumps overhead any time soon ‚Äî the technology is promising for many reasons, but still years away from general use.
