longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively-managed exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) that will invest in a diversified portfolio of publicly-traded real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) listed primarily on U.S. stock exchanges, and to a lesser extent, stock exchanges in Canada, Europe, and Asia. The fund will invest in REITs and MBS that, in the determination of the fund’s sub-adviser, have similar qualitative characteristics to the aggregate real estate portfolio holdings of a select group of public, non-traded REITs.
