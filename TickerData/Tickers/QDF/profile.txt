longBusinessSummary§The underlying index is designed to reflect the performance of a selection of companies that, in aggregate, provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented universe of long-only U.S. equity securities, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust 1250 Index (the “parent index”), a float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted index of U.S. domiciled large- and mid-capitalization companies.
