longBusinessSummary§Under normal conditions, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in U.S. bonds. The fund’s overall investment strategy is to provide total returns that exceed the total returns of its benchmark index, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. The index is a broadly diversified index that typically consists of investment-grade, fixed income instruments with intermediate- to long-term maturities. The adviser generally invests in a wide range of bonds represented in the index.
