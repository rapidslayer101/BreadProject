longBusinessSummary§Limitless Earth plc is a principal investment firm specializing in investments in all stages of development and sectors that benefit significantly from demographic change. The firm invests principally, but not exclusively, in such sectors. It invests in small companies where there are clear catalysts for value appreciation and the companies are operating in sectors exhibiting long term growth linked to demographic change. The firm primarily invests in companies involved in sourcing, transformation, and selling of energy, water, food, and housing; technological innovations such as the internet, ways of working, and leisure time; and products and services that cater for the requirements and preferences of older people. Examples of such sectors include cleantech, life sciences, nanotech, medtech, recycling, and new internet opportunities. The firm typically invests in Europe with a focus on United Kingdom but also considers investments in other geographical regions. The firm typically becomes a passive or an active investor, acquiring minority positions with strategic influence or larger controlling positions. It prefers to take a seat on the Board of the investee companies. The firm may invest in either quoted or unquoted securities made directly or indirectly in partnerships or joint ventures or into individual assets. Limitless Earth plc was founded in December, 2013 and is based in Barnet, United Kingdom.
