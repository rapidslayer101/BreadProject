longBusinessSummary§The index is designed to measure the performance of a portfolio of futures contracts on carbon credits issued under the California Carbon Allowance “cap and trade” regime. The index includes only carbon credit futures that mature in December of the next one to two years. The fund will generally seek to obtain exposure to the same carbon credit futures that are in the index. The fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in instruments that provide exposure to California Carbon Allowances. It is non-diversified.
