longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's net assets will be invested in component securities of the benchmark index. The benchmark index is designed to capitalize on the theory that, over time, companies that consistently grow their dividends tend to have investment returns above overall market returns, and companies that do not grow (or cut) their dividends tend to have investment returns below overall market returns.
