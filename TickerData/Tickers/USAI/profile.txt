longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's total assets (exclusive of any collateral held from securities lending) will be invested in the component securities of the index and depositary receipts representing foreign securities. The index uses a proprietary, rules-based methodology to measure the performance of a portfolio of U.S. and Canadian exchange-listed equity securities of companies that generate a majority of their cash flow from certain qualifying "midstream" energy infrastructure activities. The fund is non-diversified.
