longBusinessSummary§Under normal market conditions, the fund will invest in municipal bond closed-end funds trading at a discount or premium to their underlying net asset value and that pay regular periodic cash distributions. While it will invest primarily in closed-end funds, the fund may invest up to 30% of its assets in municipal or short term Treasury ETFs if in the adviser's discretion, the ETFs will provide a better investment opportunity or liquidity for the asset class.
