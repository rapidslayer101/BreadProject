longBusinessSummary§The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by primarily investing in a portfolio of investment grade, short-term fixed, variable and floating-rate securities. The fund is not a money market fund and does not seek to maintain a stable net asset value. The fund is actively managed, not designed to track a benchmark, and therefore not constrained by the composition of a benchmark.
