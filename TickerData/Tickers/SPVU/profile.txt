longBusinessSummary§The fund generally will invest at least 90% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the underlying index. The underlying index is designed to measure the performance of 100 stocks in the S&P 500® Index that have the highest "value score," which the index provider calculates based on fundamental ratios of a company's stock. A value stock tends to trade at a lower price relative to such fundamentals and thus may be considered undervalued by investors.
