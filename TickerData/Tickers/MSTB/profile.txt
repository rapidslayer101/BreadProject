longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively-managed ETF and seeks to achieve its objective principally by investing in instruments linked directly or indirectly to the performance and/or volatility of the S&P 500® Index based on statistical analyses that seek to estimate the direction of the S&P 500. Under normal market conditions, the fund’s baseline exposure each day to the S&P 500 is approximately 100%, which the fund’s portfolio managers then adjust based on a statistical method of analysis evaluating the movement of the VIX Index. The fund is non-diversified.
