longBusinessSummary§The fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the underlying index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of the underlying index. The index is designed to measure the performance of the large-, mid- and small-capitalization segments of the equity market in Finland. The underlying index uses a capping methodology that limits the weight of any single “group entity” to a maximum of 25% of the underlying index weight. The fund is non-diversified.
