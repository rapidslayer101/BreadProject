longBusinessSummary§Under normal market conditions, the fund invests in a portfolio of equity, U.S. Treasury, commodity, and foreign exchange futures contracts (collectively, “Futures Contracts”). Typically, it will not invest directly in commodity futures contracts. The Advisor expects to gain exposure to these investments by investing up to 25% of its assets in a wholly-owned subsidiary of the fund organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the “Subsidiary”).
