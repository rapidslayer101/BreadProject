longBusinessSummary§The adviser pursues the fund's investment objective by implementing a proprietary, “market neutral” investment strategy designed to seek income from the fund's investments while maintaining a low correlation to the foreign and domestic equity and bond markets. The adviser uses a multi-strategy approach. The fund will be actively managed, meaning that the sub-advisor may make changes to the fund's portfolio at any time.
