longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively-managed exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) that seeks to achieve its objective by investing principally in the common stocks of U.S. and non-U.S. companies interested in influencing public policy through their lobbying activity in Washington D.C. Strategas Asset Management, LLC (the “Adviser”) considers lobbying a nontraditional and largely unrecognized factor in company analysis. It may, from time to time, invest a significant portion of its total assets in securities of companies in certain sectors or located in particular countries or regions outside the U.S.
