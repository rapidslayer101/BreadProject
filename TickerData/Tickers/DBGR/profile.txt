longBusinessSummary§The fund, using a "passive" or indexing investment approach, seeks investment results that correspond generally to the performance, before fees and expenses, of the underlying index, which is designed to track the performance of the German equity market while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the U.S. dollar and the euro. It will invest at least 80% of its total assets (but typically far more) in component securities of the underlying index. The fund is non-diversified.
