longBusinessSummary§The index seeks to create a passively managed proxy for deep value investing by using propriety investment screens to identify 200 stocks from a universe of potential investment candidates of the cheapest quintile of the top 1,000 U.S. stocks by market capitalization, based on one year forward median analyst projected PE ratio, per FactSet. The fund's adviser attempts to replicate the index by investing all of the fund's assets in the stocks that make up the index, holding stock of each company in the index in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index.
