longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in bonds. "Assets" means net assets plus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes. The fund's assets are invested primarily in debt securities of issuers located in countries other than the United States. It may invest in developed or emerging markets, including sovereign debt issued by countries in developed and emerging markets. In managing the fund, the adviser will seek to diversify the fund's portfolio by investing in issuers in at least three countries other than the U.S. under normal circumstances.
