longBusinessSummary§The fund is actively managed and seeks to invest primarily in equity securities selected from a universe of developed market equities, excluding the United States and Canada, that exhibit value characteristics based on the selection results of a proprietary, quantitative artificial intelligence (“AI”) model developed by Sub-Adviser. The equity securities selected by the AI model typically have a lower price-to-book ratio, a lower price-to-earnings ratio, and greater free cash flow. The fund is non-diversified.
