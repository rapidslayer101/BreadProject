longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively managed exchange-traded fund ("ETF") that seeks to achieve its objective principally by investing in a portfolio of U.S.-listed equity securities, while limiting downside risk by purchasing exchange-listed put options on one or more of such equity securities or on broad-based indexes or ETFs that track the performance of the U.S. equity market. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes) will be invested in equity securities.
