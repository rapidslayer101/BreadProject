longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively-managed exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in two complimentary investment strategies, a bond strategy and a managed futures strategy. The fund uses leverage to “stack” the total return of holdings in the fund’s bond strategy together with the potential returns of the fund’s managed futures strategy. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, in (a) the bond strategy and (b) the managed futures strategy. The fund is non-diversified.
