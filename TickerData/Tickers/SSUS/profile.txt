longBusinessSummary§The fund is considered a "fund of funds" that, under normal market conditions, seeks to achieve its investment objective by principally investing in unaffiliated equity exchange traded funds ("ETFs") that track the performance of the individual sectors ("Sectors") of the S&P 500 Index. The Advisor will attempt to enhance returns relative to the index by overweighting and underweighting its exposure to the Sectors relative to the index and may reduce its overall exposure to ETFs as determined by its risk management model. It is non-diversified.
