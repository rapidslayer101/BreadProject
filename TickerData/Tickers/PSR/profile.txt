longBusinessSummary§The fund invests normally at least 80% of its assets in securities of companies that are principally engaged in the U.S. real estate industry and included within the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index. It also may invest in real estate operating companies ("REOCs"), as well as securities of other companies principally engaged in the U.S. real estate industry. REOCs are similar to REITs, except that REOCs reinvest their earnings into the business, rather than distributing them to unitholders like REITs.
