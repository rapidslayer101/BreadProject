longBusinessSummary§The fund invests in long and short positions in exchange-traded futures contracts across the broad asset classes of equities, fixed income, and currencies. The advisor expects, under normal circumstances, to invest a large portion of the portfolio in investment grade debt securities in order to collateralize its derivative investments, for liquidity purposes, or to enhance yield. It may hold fixed income instruments of varying maturities, but that have an average duration of less than one year. The fund is non-diversified.
