longBusinessSummary§The fund normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in securities that track and/or comprise the fund's benchmark index. The index is a rules-based index that follows a proprietary model developed by Ned Davis Research, Inc. in conjunction with CMG Capital Management Group, Inc. To help limit potential loss associated with adverse market conditions, the model produces trade signals that dictate the index's equity allocation ranging from 100% fully invested to 100% in cash.
