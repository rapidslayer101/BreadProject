longBusinessSummary§Generally, the Advisor buys and sells securities for the Portfolio with the goals of: (i) delaying and minimizing the realization of net capital gains (e.g., selling stocks with capital losses to offset gains, realized or anticipated); and (ii) maximizing the extent to which any realized net capital gains are long-term in nature (i.e., taxable at lower capital gains tax rates). The Portfolio is designed to purchase a broad and diverse group of securities of non-U.S. companies in countries with developed and emerging markets.
