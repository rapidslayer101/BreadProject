longBusinessSummary§The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets in common stocks of domestic companies listed and traded on U.S. national securities exchanges that the sub-advisor believes exhibit low future expected volatility. To implement this strategy, the sub-advisor employs volatility forecasting models to forecast future expected volatility. The strategy is largely quantitative and rules-based, but also includes multiple parameters over which the sub-advisor may exercise discretion in connection with its active management of the fund.
