longBusinessSummary§The fund advisor seeks to provide broad exposure to commodities across three different sustainability focused themes: agriculture, renewable energy and electrification. In order to provide such exposure, the fund will invest primarily in derivatives instruments for which the underlying assets are commodities and equity securities that are economically tied to particular commodities. The fund’s exposure to each of the three sustainability themes will be approximately equally weighted. The fund is non-diversified.
