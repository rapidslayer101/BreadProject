longBusinessSummary§The fund generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the index. The index applies an alternative weighting methodology to the S&P Composite 1500 Index so that stocks with relatively strong momentum are overweight relative to the S&P Composite 1500 Index and stocks with relatively weak momentum are underweight. The fund is non-diversified.
