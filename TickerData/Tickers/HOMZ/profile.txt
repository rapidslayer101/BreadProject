longBusinessSummary§The index is a rules-based index composed of 100 companies that collectively represent the performance of the U.S. residential housing industry. Normally at least 80% of the fund’s net assets will be invested in real estate and housing-related companies. It will generally use a “replication” strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it generally will invest in all of the component securities of the index in approximately the same proportion as in the index.
