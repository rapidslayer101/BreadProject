longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively managed exchange traded fund (“ETF”) that seeks to build a portfolio of approximately 50 to 100 securities across a broad spectrum of market capitalizations and sectors. To achieve its investment objective, it invests primarily in equity securities traded on U.S. exchanges of any size that the fund’s investment adviser, Cultivar Capital, Inc. (the “Adviser”), believes are under-valued, or under-appreciated, by other participants in the broader equity market. The fund is non-diversified.
