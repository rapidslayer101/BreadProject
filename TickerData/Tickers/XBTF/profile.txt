longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively managed ETF that invests, under normal circumstances, in standardized, cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts (“Bitcoin Futures”) traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). The fund does not invest in bitcoin or other digital assets directly. The fund seeks to invest in Bitcoin Futures so that the total value of the bitcoin to which the fund has economic exposure is approximately 100% of the total assets of the fund (the “Target Exposure”). The fund is non-diversified.
