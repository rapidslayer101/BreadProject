longBusinessSummary§The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its assets in common stocks listed in the United States, with an emphasis on large-capitalization stocks that have a strong track record of paying dividends or that are believed to be undervalued (or futures that have similar economic characteristics). It typically employs a "value" approach in selecting investments. The fund's in-house research team seeks companies that appear to be undervalued by various measures and may be temporarily out of favor but have good prospects for capital appreciation and dividend growth.
