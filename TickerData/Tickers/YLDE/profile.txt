longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, if any, in dividend-paying stocks or other instruments with similar economic characteristics that offer the potential for income growth and capital appreciation over time and that meet its financial and environmental, social and governance ("ESG") criteria. The fund may also invest in companies that the subadviser believes are making substantial progress toward becoming a leader in ESG policies.
