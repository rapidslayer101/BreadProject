longBusinessSummary§The fund invests, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its assets in U.S.-listed large capitalization equity securities. Equity securities generally include common stock. These securities may be listed on an exchange or traded over-the-counter. The fund may, at times, hold fewer securities and a higher percentage of cash and cash equivalents when, among other reasons, Fort Washington cannot find a sufficient number of securities that meet its purchase requirements. It is non-diversified.
