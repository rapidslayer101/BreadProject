longBusinessSummary§The fund employs a “passive management” investment approach designed to track the total return performance, before fees and expenses, of the index. The index is comprised of A-Shares issued by the 50 largest companies in the China A-Shares market. At least 80% of the fund’s total assets will be invested in the component securities of the index. The fund may invest the remainder of its assets in investments that are not included in the index, but which the Sub-Adviser believes will help it track the index.
