longBusinessSummary§The index, as designed, has two components: an S&P 500 Index component and a dividend component consisting of long positions in annual futures contracts that provide exposure to ordinary dividends paid on the common stocks of companies included in the S&P 500. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's net assets will be invested in large cap equity securities that are principally traded in the U.S. and derivatives based on those securities. It is non-diversified.
