longBusinessSummary§The index is a rules-based, reverse capitalization weighted index comprised of constituents of the S&P 500 ® Index, which consists of approximately 500 leading U.S.-listed companies representing approximately 80% of the U.S. equity market capitalization. The fund will generally use a “replication” strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it generally will invest in all of the component securities of the index in approximately the same proportion as in the index.
