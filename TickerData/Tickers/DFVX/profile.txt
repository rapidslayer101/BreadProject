longBusinessSummary§The advisor implements an integrated investment approach that combines research, portfolio design, portfolio management, and trading functions. The portfolio is designed to purchase a broad and diverse group of readily marketable securities of U.S. large cap companies that the advisor determines to have higher profitability and lower relative price as compared to other U.S. large cap companies at the time of purchase. As a non-fundamental policy, under normal circumstances, the portfolio will invest at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of large cap U.S. companies.
