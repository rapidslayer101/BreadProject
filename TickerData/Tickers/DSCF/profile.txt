longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively-managed ETF that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a portfolio of other large, broad-based ETFs that the sub-adviser believes can reduce the fund’s relative stock and bond risks when compared to a traditional diversified market cap-weighted index fund. The fund’s allocation between broad-based U.S. equity ETFs and broad-based foreign focused equity ETFs will generally align with the then-current market cap weighting of the U.S. and foreign equity markets. The fund’s bond sleeve will be comprised of between two and four underlying ETFs.
