longBusinessSummary§In seeking to achieve its investment objective, The Advisor attempts to maintain exposure to futures contracts that are substantially the same as those included in the index. The index is designed to measure the performance of metals, which will be increasingly required for the energy transition away from fossil fuels by investing in futures contracts on those metals (“metal futures”). The fund is non-diversified.
