longBusinessSummary§The fund is a “fund of funds,” meaning that it primarily invests its assets in the shares of other ETFs, rather than in securities of individual companies. Its portfolio will be composed primarily of the other ETFs advised by the Adviser. Currently, there are four Alpha Architect ETFs, which invest in either domestic or international equity securities, and employ either a “momentum” or a “value” investment strategy.
