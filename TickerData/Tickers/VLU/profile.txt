longBusinessSummary§The fund employs a sampling strategy in seeking to track the index. It generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the index. The index applies an alternative weighting methodology to the S&P Composite 1500 Index so that stocks with relatively low valuations (i.e., relatively "cheap") are overweight relative to the S&P Composite 1500 Index and stocks with relatively high valuations are underweight.
