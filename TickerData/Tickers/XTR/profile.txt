longBusinessSummary§The fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index. The underlying index measures the performance of a risk management strategy that holds the underlying stocks of the S&P 500® Index and applies a protective put strategy (i.e. long (purchased) put options) on the S&P 500® Index. The adviser expects that the correlation between the fund's performance and that of the underlying index, before fees and expenses, will exceed 95%.
