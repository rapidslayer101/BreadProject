longBusinessSummary§The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets in securities of the index. Because the index is comprised of securities issued by other investment companies, the fund operates in a manner that is commonly referred to as a "fund of funds," meaning that it invests its assets in shares of funds that are included in the index. The index seeks to measure the performance of the top 45 U.S. exchange-listed closed-end funds.
