longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, in sustainable companies. The fund may invest in companies of all sizes and across economic sectors and geography. Although the advisor will attempt to invest as much of its assets as is practical in common stocks and ADRs, the advisor may maintain a reasonable (up to 20%) position in U.S. Treasury Bills and money market instruments to meet liquidity needs.
