longBusinessSummary§The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its assets in the common stocks of a diversified group of growth companies. While it may invest in companies of any market capitalization, the fund generally seeks investments in stocks of large-capitalization companies with one or more of the following characteristics: strong cash flow and an above-average rate of earnings growth; the ability to sustain earnings momentum during economic downturns; and occupation of a lucrative niche in the economy and the ability to expand even during times of slow economic growth. The fund is non-diversified.
