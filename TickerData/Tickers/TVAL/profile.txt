longBusinessSummary§The fund will invest primarily in U.S. equity securities. In taking a value approach to investment selection, the adviser seeks to identify companies that appear to be undervalued by various measures, and may be temporarily out of favor, but have good prospects for capital appreciation. Some of the principal measures used to identify such stocks are: price/earnings ratio, price/book value ratio, price/sales ratio, dividend yield, price/cash flow, undervalued assets, and restructuring opportunities. The fund may purchase the stocks of companies of any size, but typically focuses on larger companies.
