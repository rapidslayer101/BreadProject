longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively-managed exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in publicly-traded real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that derive their revenue from ownership and/or management of residential properties. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in Residential REITs. The remainder of the fund’s net assets typically will be invested in U.S. real estate-related securities that are traded on a U.S. exchange (“Real Estate-Related Securities”). The fund is non-diversified.
