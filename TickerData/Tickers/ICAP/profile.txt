longBusinessSummary§The fund, under normal conditions, will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of companies that pay dividends during normal market conditions. The fund invests primarily in securities of U.S. companies, but may invest in foreign securities, including securities of companies located in emerging markets. To obtain high yield and total return, the adviser will favor sectors and industries that it currently views are undervalued on a relative basis.
