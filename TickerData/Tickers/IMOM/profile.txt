longBusinessSummary§The Adviser employs a multi-step, quantitative, rules-based methodology to identify a portfolio of approximately 50 to 100 non-U.S. equity securities with the highest relative momentum. A “momentum” style of investing emphasizes investing in securities that have had higher recent total return performance compared to other securities. The Adviser then employs proprietary screens to eliminate companies with issues that may negatively impact their momentum. The fund may also invest up to 20% of its assets in cash and cash equivalents, other investment companies, as well as securities and other instruments.
