longBusinessSummary§The investment seeks to provide total return through long-term capital appreciation and current income. The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a diversified group of U.S.-traded equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock, ADRs, and REITs. Under normal circumstances, it invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in small cap securities. The fund&#39;s sub-advisor generally defines a small cap company as one having a market capitalization less than the market cap of the largest company in the Russell 2000 Index at the time of acquisition.
