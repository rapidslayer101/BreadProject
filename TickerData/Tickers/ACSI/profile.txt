longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, will be invested in investments that are tied economically to the United States. Construction of the index begins with over 400 ACSI Companies across 46 industries and 10 economic sectors. The initial universe is then screened to eliminate companies whose stock is not principally listed on a U.S. exchange, whose market capitalization is less than $1 billion, or for which the Customer Satisfaction Data is statistically insignificant.
