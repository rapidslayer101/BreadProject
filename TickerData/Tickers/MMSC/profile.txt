longBusinessSummary§Under normal market conditions, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities issued by small capitalization companies. The fund's adviser considers small capitalization companies to be those companies with market capitalizations, at the time of investment, within the market capitalization range of the companies comprising the Russell 2000® Growth Index. SIMG recommends securities to First Trust with respect to its allocated portion of the fund’s assets pursuant to its foundational belief that earnings growth drives stock performance. The fund is non-diversified.
