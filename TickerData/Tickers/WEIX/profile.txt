longBusinessSummary§The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective, under normal circumstances, by obtaining investment exposure to an actively managed portfolio of short positions in futures contracts with monthly expirations (“VIX Futures Contracts”), which are based on the CBOE Volatility Index. The advisor expects to primarily take short positions in VIX Futures Contracts by shorting the next two near term VIX Futures Contracts and rolling the nearest month VIX Futures Contract to the next month on a daily basis. The fund is non-diversified.
