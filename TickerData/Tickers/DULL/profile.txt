longBusinessSummary§The notes are designed to reflect a 3x leveraged inverse exposure to the inverse performance of the ETF on a daily basis. The notes are riskier than securities that have intermediate- or long-term investment objectives, and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day or who have a “buy and hold” strategy.
