longBusinessSummary§The fund generally will invest at least 80% of its total assets in securities that comprise the underlying index. The Adviser employs a "full replication" methodology in seeking to track the underlying index, meaning that the fund generally invests in all of the securities comprising the index in proportion to their weightings in the index. The index is designed to measure the performance of equity securities of U.S. companies that tend to have larger, higher quality businesses.
