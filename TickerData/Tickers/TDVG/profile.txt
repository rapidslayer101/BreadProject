longBusinessSummary§The fund normally invests at least 80% of the fund's assets in stocks that have a strong track record of paying dividends or are expected to pay dividends over time (even if not currently paying dividends) (or futures that have similar economic characteristics). It primarily invests in exchange-traded securities that trade synchronously with the fund's shares, cash, and cash equivalents. The fund may also invest in ADRs and common stocks listed on a foreign exchange that trade on such exchange synchronously with the fund's shares (i.e., during the U.S. listing exchange's trading hours).
