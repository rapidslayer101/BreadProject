longBusinessSummary§The fund's sub-adviser seeks to achieve its investment objective, by using various proprietary analytical investment models that examine current and historical market data to attempt to predict the performance of the S&P 500® Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is composed primarily of large-capitalization U.S. issuers. The Sub-Adviser implements the fund’s S&P 500® investment strategy by taking positions in one or more ETFs that seek to track the performance of the S&P 500® (each an “S&P 500®-related ETF”).
