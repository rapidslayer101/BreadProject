longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in small-capitalization equity securities. The Sub-Adviser considers small-capitalization companies to be those with market capitalizations within the range of the market capitalization of companies included in the S&P SmallCap 600® Index. Although it invests primarily in small-capitalization securities, the fund may invest in equity securities of companies of any capitalization. The equity securities in which it invests are mainly common stocks.
