longBusinessSummary§The fund is an exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) that uses a “passive management” (or indexing) approach to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the index. The index employs a rules-driven approach, without the use of leverage, with the goal of identifying a portfolio of written put options on the S&P 500 Index, that when sold in accordance with the index’s rules driven approach, will collectively provide over the long term a total return that will exceed that of the S&P 500 Index with lower volatility and drawdown.
