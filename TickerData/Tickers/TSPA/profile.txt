longBusinessSummary§The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its assets in U.S. equity securities (or futures that have similar economic characteristics). The advisor attempts to create a portfolio with similar characteristics to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index® (index) with the potential to provide excess returns relative to the index. The fund will generally remain fully invested (less than 5% in cash reserves) and seeks to be sector neutral when compared to the index. The fund is non-diversified.
