Through the two strategies, it may invest in or obtain exposure to: (i) equity securities (which may include common stocks and preferred stocks), (ii) debt securities (which may include bonds, notes, debentures, banker's acceptances and commercial paper), (iii) commodity-linked derivative instruments and (iv) currency-related derivative instruments.
