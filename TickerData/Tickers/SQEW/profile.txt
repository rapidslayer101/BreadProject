longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively managed exchange traded fund ("ETF") that normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, including any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities. The adviser employs a contrarian strategy seeking to buy underperforming asset classes and/or factors and sell outperforming asset classes and/or factors based on quantitative research. It may have a higher degree of portfolio turnover than funds that seek to replicate the performance of an index.
