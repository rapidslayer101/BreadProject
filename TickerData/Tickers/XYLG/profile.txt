longBusinessSummary§The fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index. The underlying index measures the performance of a theoretical portfolio that holds a portfolio of the stocks included in the S&P 500® Index (the "reference index"), and "writes" (or sells) a succession of one-month at-the-money covered call options on the reference index. It generally will use a replication strategy.
