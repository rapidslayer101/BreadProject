longBusinessSummary§The fund seeks to primarily invest, through its subsidiary, in one or more excess return swaps on the index. The index is composed of futures contracts on physical commodities and is constructed using QCI’s proprietary quantitative methodology, which considers a commodity’s relative inflation sensitivity and the relative cost of holding a “rolling” futures position in the commodity. It is non-diversified.
