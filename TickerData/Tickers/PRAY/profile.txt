longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, the fund invests in equity securities, including common stock and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) of international and domestic companies. The fund at a minimum will, under normal market conditions, invest 80% of its assets (net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes, if any) in biblically responsible investments. Except for its cash-type holdings, the sub-adviser intends to invest 100% of its assets in stocks that satisfy these Christian values under normal market conditions.
