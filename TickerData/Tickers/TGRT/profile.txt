longBusinessSummary§The fund will invest primarily in U.S. equity securities. The adviser uses a growth style of investing. Accordingly, the adviser looks for companies with an above-average rate of earnings, cash flow growth, and a lucrative niche in the economy that gives them the ability to sustain earnings momentum even during times of slow economic growth. The fund may purchase the stocks of companies of any size, but typically focuses on large-cap companies. The fund is non-diversified.
