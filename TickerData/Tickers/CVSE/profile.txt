longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund’s net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) will be invested in the equity securities of U.S. issuers. The fund is actively managed, not designed to track a benchmark, and therefore not constrained by the composition of a benchmark. The fund primarily invests in the equity securities of large capitalization U.S. issuers that are involved in economic activities that address global environmental or societal challenges that relate to areas such as environmental sustainability and resource efficiency.
