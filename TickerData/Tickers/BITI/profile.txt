longBusinessSummary§The fund invests in financial instruments that ProShare Advisors believes, in combination, should produce daily returns consistent with the daily target. The fund does not invest directly in bitcoin nor does it directly short bitcoin. Instead, the fund seeks to benefit from decreases in the price of bitcoin futures contracts for a single day. The index measures the performance of the front-month bitcoin futures contract trading on the CME. It is non-diversified.
