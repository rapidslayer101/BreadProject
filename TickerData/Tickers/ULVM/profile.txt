longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its assets in securities in the index. The index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of large-capitalization U.S. issuers within the Nasdaq U.S. Large Cap 500 Index (the “parent index”) that have higher exposure to value and momentum factors, while also maintaining moderate index turnover and lower realized volatility than traditional capitalization-weighted indexes.
