longBusinessSummary§The index selects companies which may benefit from transformational changes in how people work, take care of their health, and consume and connect ("Transformational Changes") - changes accelerated by COVID-19. The fund will generally use a “replication strategy” to achieve its investment objective, meaning that it will invest in all of the component securities of the index in approximately the same proportion as the index.
