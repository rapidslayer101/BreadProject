longBusinessSummary§The fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets, but typically far more, in instruments that comprise the underlying index. The index generally aims to keep the broad characteristics of its parent index, the J.P. Morgan DM High Yield USD Index (a USD denominated high yield corporate bond index of developed market issuers), resulting in a broad high yield fixed income market exposure with ESG aspects.
