longBusinessSummary§The index is designed to provide broad exposure to the U.S. dollar-denominated investment grade corporate bond sector while at the same time mitigating or "hedging" against U.S. dollar currency risk through the implementation of a gold inflation hedge. Under normal conditions, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes) directly, or indirectly through total return swaps, in bonds. It is non-diversified.
