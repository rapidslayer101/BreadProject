longBusinessSummary§The fund generally invests in common stocks of U.S. companies that have a market capitalization greater than $2 billion. It seeks to deliver a lower realized portfolio volatility than its benchmark, the S&P 500® Index, by utilizing a stock selection process that expands on traditional measures of price volatility by including measures of asymmetric volatility and seeking securities of businesses that demonstrate consistent cash-flows, stable operations, and strong balance sheets. The fund is an actively managed ETF that does not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index.
