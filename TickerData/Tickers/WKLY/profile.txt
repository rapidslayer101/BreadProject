longBusinessSummary§The index follows a rules-based methodology that tracks the performance of the equity securities of publicly-traded, large- and mid-capitalization U.S. and non-U.S. companies in developed markets that are selected based on a set of dividend filters focused on dividend sustainability. The adviser attempts to invest all, or substantially all, of its assets in the component securities that make up the index. The fund will invest at least 80% its net assets in dividend paying securities. It is non-diversified.
