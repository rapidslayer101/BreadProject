longBusinessSummary§Under normal market conditions, the portfolio managers will invest at least 80% of the fund's net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in convertible securities. Convertible securities have characteristics similar to both bonds and common stocks and typically consist of debt securities and preferred stocks that may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock or other equity security, of the same or a different issuer, within a particular time period, at a specified price. The fund may invest in high-yield securities. It is non-diversified.
