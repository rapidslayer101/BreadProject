longBusinessSummary§Under normal market conditions, the fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in equity ETFs. The fund is a “fund of funds,” meaning that it seeks to achieve its objective by investing in other Avantis ETFs (collectively, the underlying funds). The underlying funds represent a broadly diversified basket of equity securities that seek to select or overweight securities that are expected to have higher returns or better risk characteristics than a passive, market-cap weighted index.
