longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's total assets will be invested in component securities of the index and investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of such component securities. The index tracks the value of a cash-secured put option sales strategy, which consists of selling put options on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and a cash collateral account that accrues interest at a theoretical three-month treasury bill rate. The fund is non-diversified.
