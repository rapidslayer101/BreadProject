longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in component securities of the index. The index is designed to measure the performance of publicly traded companies that principally sell online or through other non-store sales channels, such as through mobile or app purchases, rather than through "bricks and mortar" store locations. The fund is non-diversified.
