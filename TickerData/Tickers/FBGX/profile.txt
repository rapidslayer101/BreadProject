longBusinessSummary§The UBS AG FI Enhanced Large Cap Growth ETN due June 19, 2024 (the “Securities”) are a series of FI Enhanced ETNs. The level of the index reflects both the price performance of the index constituent Securities and the reinvestment of dividends on the index constituent securities. The Securities are two times leveraged with respect to the index and, as a result, may benefit from two times any positive, but will be exposed to two times any negative, quarterly performance of the index.
