longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively-managed "exchanged-traded fund of funds" and seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in other registered investment companies, including other actively-managed exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") and index-based ETFs (collectively, "underlying funds"), that provide exposure to a broad range of asset classes. The underlying funds may invest in equity securities of U.S. or foreign companies; debt obligations of U.S. or foreign companies or governments; or investments such as volatility indexes and managed futures.
