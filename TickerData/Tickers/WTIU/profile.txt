longBusinessSummary§The notes are designed to reflect a 3x leveraged long exposure to the performance of the index on a daily basis, before taking into account the negative effect of the Daily Investor Fee, the Daily Financing Charge and the Redemption Fee Amount, if applicable. However, due to the daily resetting leverage, the returns on the notes over different periods of time can, and most likely will, differ significantly from three times the return on a direct long investment in the index.
