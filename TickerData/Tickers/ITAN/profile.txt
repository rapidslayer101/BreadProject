longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively-managed exchange-traded fund (“ETF”). The fund will invest in U.S.-listed equity securities that Sparkline Capital LP (the “Sub-Adviser”) believes are attractive relative to its proprietary measure of “intangible-augmented intrinsic value.” The fund’s investments may include common stocks and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Although the fund will not concentrate its investments in a particular industry, the Sub-Adviser anticipates that fund will hold a meaningful amount of stocks in the technology, communications, healthcare, and consumer discretionary sectors.
