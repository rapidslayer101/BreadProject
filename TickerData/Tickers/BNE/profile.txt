longBusinessSummary§The index seeks to track the performance of a portfolio of companies that are leaders, enablers, and beneficiaries of a transformational shift in the way energy is produced, stored, distributed, and consumed. The fund will generally use a "replication" strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will generally invest in all of the component securities of the index in the same approximate proportions as in the index.
