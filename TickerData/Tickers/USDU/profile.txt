longBusinessSummary§The fund is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide total returns, before fees and expenses, that exceed the performance of the index. The index is structured to potentially benefit as the U.S. dollar appreciates relative to a basket of global currencies. The fund will seek exposure to both the U.S. dollar and global currencies held by the index through investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets in money market securities and other liquid securities. It is non-diversified.
