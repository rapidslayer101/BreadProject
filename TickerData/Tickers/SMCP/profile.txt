longBusinessSummary§Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) directly or indirectly in small cap companies. The Adviser seeks to invest in companies with a proven history of consistent growth, sustainable earnings momentum and the ability to produce a reliable stream of cash flow during all economic cycles. The Adviser uses a “bottom-up” internal stock screening process designed to identify companies that produce reliable cash flow streams and are priced at a level that provides for growth opportunity.
