longBusinessSummary§The index is a market-capitalization weighted index that is comprised of 100 U.S. large-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies with the highest composite scores based on two fundamental factors: growth and quality, which are equally weighted. To the extent the index concentrates (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in the securities of a particular industry or group of industries, the fund will concentrate its investments to approximately the same extent as the index. It is non-diversified.
