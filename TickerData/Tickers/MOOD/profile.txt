longBusinessSummary§The fund’s investment strategy is to seek to grow capital by tactically investing in other ETFs that invest in equities, bonds, commodities, currencies, and gold based on “relative sentiment” factors. The fund’s portfolio will be tactically allocated among passively-managed U.S. and foreign, developed market, equity ETFs, bond ETFs, and, in some instances, gold exchange-traded products (ETPs), commodities ETPs, and currency ETPs. The fund is non-diversified.
