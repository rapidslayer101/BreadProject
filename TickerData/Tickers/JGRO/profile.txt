longBusinessSummary§The fund will invest primarily in equity securities of U.S. large-capitalization companies, but the adviser has discretion to invest in securities across the whole market capitalization spectrum, including securities of mid-capitalization and small-capitalization companies. In implementing its main strategies, the fund invests primarily in common stocks. To the extent the fund uses derivatives, the fund will primarily use futures contracts to more effectively gain targeted equity exposure from its cash positions. It is non-diversified.
