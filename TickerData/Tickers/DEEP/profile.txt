longBusinessSummary§The index was established in 2020 by Acquirers Funds, LLC and tracks the performance of a portfolio of 100 of the most undervalued, fundamentally strong stocks drawn from the smallest 75% of stocks listed in the U.S. by market capitalization meeting certain liquidity thresholds. The fund uses a “passive management” approach to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the index. The fund generally will invest in all of the component securities of the index in the same approximate proportions as in the index.
