longBusinessSummary§Under normal conditions, the fund will invest at least 90% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in the securities that comprise the index. The index has been designed based upon the principle that the asset class exhibiting the highest levels of "relative strength," based on current prices, will be the asset class with the best performance over the near term.
